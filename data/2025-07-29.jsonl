By leveraging the semantic\nframework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies\n(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be\norganized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then\nused to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based\non the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term\n`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.\nAdditionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,\nwhich conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic\nconcept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an\nalternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process\nprofiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,\nwe demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be\nseamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis\nand decision-making.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement\nLearning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning\nabilities.

Real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes\nunsafe, making large-scale validation impractical. In contrast, simulation\nenvironments offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for rigorous\nverification and validation. A critical component of the validation process is\nscenario generation, which involves designing and configuring traffic scenarios\nto evaluate autonomous systems' responses to various events and uncertainties.\nHowever, existing scenario generation tools often require programming\nknowledge, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. To address this\nlimitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario\ngeneration. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to\ncreate, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding\nexpertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as\nScenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports\na broader user base. Central to our framework is a graph-based scenario\nrepresentation that facilitates structured management, supports both manual and\nautomated generation, and enables integration with deep learning-based scenario\nand behavior generation methods. In automated mode, the framework can randomly\nsample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,\nallowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets.

High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides\nthe temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a\nhierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this\nchallenging task.

Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites.

We\nexpand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer\nvideo context from an near-global perspective. \\textbf{Video-level\nAssociation}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense\ntemporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion\ntrajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \\textbf{Modality\nScalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn\ncross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently\ncompress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training\nmanner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following\nbenefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for\nthe inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is\nleveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that\nrequire independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates\nthe training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive\nexperiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\\modaltracker}\nachieves a new \\textit{SOTA} performance.

However, traditional\nRL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to\nlong-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement\nLearning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning\nabilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short\nsegments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive\nTokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment\nrollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with\n128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\\% to\n85.1\\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\\% to 61.9\\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B\nwith remarkable gains.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To\nmitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase\napproximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned\ndata traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from\n\"pseudo-convergence\", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but\nstill preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification\nand generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach\nmaintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack\naccuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full\nretraining from scratch."}

The multiscale\ntemporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of\nlabeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging\nresearch problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture\ncalled the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),\nwhich is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient\nanomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and\ncomplementary information. The main processing path of this framework\nintegrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the\nConvolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained\nrepresentation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features\nthrough a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature\nfusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy\ndistribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention\nmapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a\ncontrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic\nalignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order\nsemantic guidance for spatio-temporal features.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data.
