Model-based and learning-based methods\nare widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined\nmodels of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the\nabove limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,\nexisting PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training\nefficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are\nequivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper\ndevelops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a\nrisk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a\nsafety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting\nareas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.\nThe balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding\nvehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during\ntraining. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold\nchannel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.\nMoreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions\nwith risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation\nresults on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak\nreward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky\nareas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios."}

To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency\ntrajectory optimization framework in this paper.

Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature\nset derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language\nInference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used\nto train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a\nrigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and\nproduce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.\nBy pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted\nclassifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves\nstrong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,\nand dialogue tasks, respectively.

While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic\ngesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal\nvariations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view\ndiversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component\nembedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video\ndataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.\nIt includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects\nusing two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion\ncapture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all\ndevices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal\nalignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture\nunderstanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed\nthat mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments\nhighlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger\ndetection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a\ncomprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture\nunderstanding."}
