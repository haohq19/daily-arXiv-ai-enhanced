Its potential in clinical medicine is transformative and includes personalized treatment planning and virtual clinical trials. However, simulating patient trajectories is challenging because of complex biological and sociocultural influences. Here, we show that real-world clinical records can be leveraged to empirically model patient timelines. We developed a generative simulator model that takes a patient's history as input and synthesizes fine-grained, realistic future trajectories. The model was pretrained on more than 200 million clinical records. It produced high-fidelity future timelines, closely matching event occurrence rates, laboratory test results, and temporal dynamics in real patient future data. It also accurately estimated future event probabilities, with observed-to-expected ratios consistently near 1.0 across diverse outcomes and time horizons. Our results reveal the untapped value of real-world data in electronic health records and introduce a scalable framework for in silico modeling of clinical care."}

Despite strong in-sample performance, these models often degrade when confronted with evolving real-world market regimes, which can shift dramatically due to macroeconomic changes-e.g., monetary policy updates or unanticipated fluctuations in participant behavior. We identify two challenges that perpetuate this mismatch: (1) insufficient robustness in existing policy against uncertainties in high-level market fluctuations, and (2) the absence of a realistic and diverse simulation environment for training, leading to policy overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian Robust Framework that systematically integrates a macro-conditioned generative model with robust policy learning. On the data side, to generate realistic and diverse data, we propose a macro-conditioned GAN-based generator that leverages macroeconomic indicators as primary control variables, synthesizing data with faithful temporal, cross-instrument, and macro correlations. On the policy side, to learn robust policy against market fluctuations, we cast the trading process as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian Markov game, wherein an adversarial agent simulates shifting regimes by perturbing macroeconomic indicators in the macro-conditioned generator, while the trading agent-guided by a quantile belief network-maintains and updates its belief over hidden market states. The trading agent seeks a Robust Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via Bayesian neural fictitious self-play, stabilizing learning under adversarial market perturbations. Extensive experiments on 9 financial instruments demonstrate that our framework outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines. In extreme events like the COVID, our method shows improved profitability and risk management, offering a reliable solution for trading under uncertain and shifting market dynamics."}

While deep neural networks have been successfully used for vision-based tasks, they inherently lack provable guarantees on the correctness of their output, which is crucial for safety-critical applications. We present a framework for designing certifiable neural networks (NNs) for perception-based pose estimation that integrates physics-driven modeling with learning-based estimation. The proposed framework begins by leveraging the known geometry of planar objects commonly found in the environment, such as traffic signs and runway markings, referred to as target objects. At its core, it introduces a geometric generative model (GGM), a neural-network-like model whose parameters are derived from the image formation process of a target object observed by a camera. Once designed, the GGM can be used to train NN-based pose estimators with certified guarantees in terms of their estimation errors. We first demonstrate this framework in uncluttered environments, where the target object is the only object present in the camera's field of view. We extend this using ideas from NN reachability analysis to design certified object NN that can detect the presence of the target object in cluttered environments. Subsequently, the framework consolidates the certified object detector with the certified pose estimator to design a multi-stage perception pipeline that generalizes the proposed approach to cluttered environments, while maintaining its certified guarantees. We evaluate the proposed framework using both synthetic and real images of various planar objects commonly encountered by autonomous vehicles. Using images captured by an event-based camera, we show that the trained encoder can effectively estimate the pose of a traffic sign in accordance with the certified bound provided by the framework."}

However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces."}

The system uses a spiking neural network deployed on the neuromorphic processor AltAi to classify EMG patterns in real time while an eye-tracking headset and scene camera identify the object within the user's focus. In our prototype, the same EMG recognition model that was originally developed for a conventional GPU is deployed as a spiking network on AltAi, achieving comparable accuracy while operating in a sub-watt power regime, which enables a lightweight, wearable implementation. For six distinct functional gestures recorded from upper-limb amputees, the system achieves robust recognition performance comparable to state-of-the-art myoelectric interfaces. When the vision pipeline restricts the decision space to three context-appropriate gestures for the currently viewed object, recognition accuracy increases to roughly 95% while excluding unsafe, object-inappropriate grasps. These results indicate that the proposed neuromorphic, context-aware controller can provide energy-efficient and reliable prosthesis control and has the potential to improve safety and usability in everyday activities for people with upper-limb amputation."}

Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories.

Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case. These results form key components for the development of future guidelines on reporting performance uncertainty in medical imaging AI."}

Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments. This proof-of-concept research offers algorithmic insights and practical deployment guidelines for real-world federated healthcare systems, and thus, our results are directly transferable to hospital IT-administrators, implementing privacy-preserving collaborative learning."}

Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS."}

Despite growing interest, the evaluation of VAU remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on n-gram-based metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE-L) or LLM-based evaluation. The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos. We formulate VAU as a three-fold problem, with the goal of comprehensively understanding key descriptive elements of anomalies in video: events (What), participating entities (Who) and location (Where). Our benchmark introduces a) FVScore, a novel, human-aligned evaluation metric that assesses the presence of critical visual elements in LVLM answers, providing interpretable, fine-grained feedback; and b) FineW3, a novel, comprehensive dataset curated through a structured and fully automatic procedure that augments existing human annotations with high quality, fine-grained visual information. Human evaluation reveals that our proposed metric has a superior alignment with human perception of anomalies in comparison to current approaches. Detailed experiments on FineVAU unveil critical limitations in LVLM's ability to perceive anomalous events that require spatial and fine-grained temporal understanding, despite strong performance on coarse grain, static information, and events with strong visual cues."}

The loss is constructed to control not only the mean ROI color but also the tail of the pixelwise error distribution through CVaR-style and soft-maximum penalties, with a late-start gate and a time-dependent schedule to stabilize guidance across denoising steps.

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization."}

In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages. During multi-stage SFT, core parameters acquired in prior tasks are frozen, thereby preventing overwriting by subsequent tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted intensive experiments on multiple public datasets. The results showed that our dynamic parameter isolation strategy consistently reduced data conflicts and achieved consistent performance improvements compared to multi-stage and multi-task tuning baselines."}

To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions. In particular, our method outperforms the stable signature method by an average of 10\\% across 12 different image transformations on COCO datasets.

However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces."}

Unlike prior work, our method revises the full hierarchy to better match the semantics encoded by LMs. Experiments across three HTC benchmarks show that LLM-refined taxonomies consistently outperform human-curated ones in various settings up to +2.9pp. in F1. To better understand these improvements, we compare how well LMs can assign leaf nodes to parent nodes and vice versa across human-curated and LLM-refined taxonomies. We find that human-curated taxonomies lead to more easily separable clusters in embedding space. However, the LLM-refined taxonomies align more closely with the model's actual confusion patterns during classification. In other words, even though they are harder to separate, they better reflect the model's inductive biases. These findings suggest that LLM-guided refinement creates taxonomies that are more compatible with how models learn, improving HTC performance."}

We fine tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct to learn ontology term identifier mappings from the Human Phenotype Ontology (800 pairs) and the Gene Ontology (400 training pairs), withholding 400 GO pairs to test generalization. Treating learning as a time to event process across 20 epochs, we used stochastic decoding to detect latent knowledge at baseline and Cox proportional hazards models to identify predictors of acquisition, generalization, and degradation. Baseline deterministic recall for HPO was 2.8%, rising to 71.9% after fine-tuning. Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and was associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates and faster convergence; identifier frequency and curated annotation counts had smaller effects. Generalization to withheld GO facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely when latent knowledge was present. Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for withheld (unseen) terms than for trained (seen) terms, suggesting a protective effect of reinforcement during training. These results show that latent knowledge predicts both the speed of factual learning during fine-tuning and the limited generalization of unseen ontology facts, while resistance to degradation depends on whether facts are reinforced."}

However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification.

To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video.

Since pirated images are often geometrically distorted by operations such as scaling and cropping, accurate synchronization - detecting the embedding position of the watermark - is critical for proper extraction. In particular, cropping changes the origin of the image, making synchronization difficult. However, few existing methods are robust against cropping. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking method that estimates geometric transformations applied to a stego image using a pilot signal, allowing synchronization even after cropping. A grid-shaped pilot signal with distinct horizontal and vertical values is embedded in the image. When the image is transformed, the grid is also distorted. By analyzing this distortion, the transformation matrix can be estimated. Applying the Radon transform to the distorted image allows estimation of the grid angles and intervals. In addition, since the horizontal and vertical grid lines are encoded differently, the grid orientation can be determined, which reduces ambiguity. To validate our method, we performed simulations with anisotropic scaling, rotation, shearing, and cropping. The results show that the proposed method accurately estimates transformation matrices with low error under both single and composite attacks."}

However, conflicting objectives across heterogeneous SFT tasks often induce the \"seesaw effect\": optimizing for one task may degrade performance on others, particularly when model parameters are updated indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages. During multi-stage SFT, core parameters acquired in prior tasks are frozen, thereby preventing overwriting by subsequent tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted intensive experiments on multiple public datasets. The results showed that our dynamic parameter isolation strategy consistently reduced data conflicts and achieved consistent performance improvements compared to multi-stage and multi-task tuning baselines."}

Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case. These results form key components for the development of future guidelines on reporting performance uncertainty in medical imaging AI."}

Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS."}

Our approach combines (i) ROI-based inpainting for spatial selectivity, (ii) background-latent re-imposition to prevent color drift outside the ROI, and (iii) latent nudging via gradient guidance using a composite loss defined in CIE Lab and linear RGB. The loss is constructed to control not only the mean ROI color but also the tail of the pixelwise error distribution through CVaR-style and soft-maximum penalties, with a late-start gate and a time-dependent schedule to stabilize guidance across denoising steps. We show that mean-only baselines can satisfy average color constraints while producing perceptually salient local failures, motivating our distribution-aware objective.

We developed a generative simulator model that takes a patient's history as input and synthesizes fine-grained, realistic future trajectories. The model was pretrained on more than 200 million clinical records. It produced high-fidelity future timelines, closely matching event occurrence rates, laboratory test results, and temporal dynamics in real patient future data.

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization."}
