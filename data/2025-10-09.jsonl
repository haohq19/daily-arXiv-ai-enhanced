Recent work\nhas relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state\nrepresentations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that\nreconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from\ncurrent observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are\ndifficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as\nclassification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate\ndirectly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that\nsafety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask:\nwhen are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we\nexamine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or\nmanufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic\nsafety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing\nfailure itself. To predict such behaviors, we introduce a mutual\ninformation-based measure that identifies when observations fail to capture\nsafety-relevant features. Finally, we propose a multimodal-supervised training\nstrategy that shapes the latent state with additional sensory inputs during\ntraining, but requires no extra modalities at deployment, and validate our\napproach in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator\npreventing a pot of wax from overheating."}

Consequently, thinking after\nreceiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,\nwhere real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting\nthat humans naturally \"think while listening.\" In this paper, we propose\nSHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken\nchain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams\nthe input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received,\ngenerates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while\nthe user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide\nwhether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We\ndemonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two\nscenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math\nproblem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a\nmistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that\ninterrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can\ncomplete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn.
