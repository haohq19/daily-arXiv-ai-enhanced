In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed\ndiscrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with\narbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic\n1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,\nand identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on\ndiscrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and\nuniversal approximation guarantees.

This\nissue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected\ncompletions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended\ngoals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,\nas well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying\nreason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron\ncollapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated\nPreference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the\noutput layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly\nconstrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity\northogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far\nfrom the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive\ncapabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noffer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust\ncontrol policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has\nemerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper\nprovides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the\non-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft\nActor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct\nenvironments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed\nto guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant\npenalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all\nevaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By\ncontrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed\nonly the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in\nhazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can\noutweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms.

Yet existing methods in this direction\ntypically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and\ntherefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300\nFPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose\nEventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates\nhigh-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and\nphysics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low\nsample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking\nnetwork to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To\ncapture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with\na bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a\nbidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at\na speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit\nof accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in\ntwo downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and\ndemonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event\nsimulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale\nevent-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based\nvision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous\ndriving, and VRAR."}
