Under review at ASME Journal of Mechanical\n  Design", "summary": "Compliant mechanisms have significant potential in precision applications due\nto their ability to guide motion without contact. However, an inherent\nvulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of\ncompliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly\nchallenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and\nthe cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical\nto prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on\nstacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to\nguarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a\nsystematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in\ncompliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a\nsingle pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a\ntheoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry\nto maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that\nthe mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method\nto a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and\nprovide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers\nreliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling. This work\nestablishes a foundation for precision hard-stop design in compliant systems\noperating under uncertain loads, which is a crucial step toward enabling the\napplication of compliant mechanisms in real-world systems."}

Fine-tuning foundation\nmodels that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular\ndatabases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data\nnecessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach\nrequires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can\nstill be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events\nand for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.\nIn on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely\nautomated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the\nmodel is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with\nclassical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying\nthis form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to\nassess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even\nthough most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In\nthis paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach\nbased on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow\nthat automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified\naccuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them\nat an increased rate relative to their occurrence."}

We introduce\nDiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit\nstatic-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static\ntoken from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing\nstatic content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates\nthree key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a\ntime-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing\nstatic information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention\nthat routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens\nframe-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual\nstatic-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using\nswap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest\nswap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic\ntransfer, and reduces average cross-leakage."}
