FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted\nGeneration Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty\nModeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module\nintegrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty\ndistribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding\nbox prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with\nSAM.

Due to\nits low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the\nmainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from\nsignificant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on\nstatic heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which\nprevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical\ngap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization\nproblem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable\nnoise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies\nthe negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a\ncritical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect\ntraining. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware\ntime minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the\ncompression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and\ntraining task.

Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs)\nand Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event\nSimulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES\ndata into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation\nevents and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating\ninterdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries\nfor KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors.\nThis adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational\nissues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck\nidentification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities,\noutperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves\nnear-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies.

However, parallel inference introduces significant\ncommunication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,\nlimiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression\nframework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation\nquality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong\ntemporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,\nsaturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.\nTo address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that\nencodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via\nResidual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise\nactivation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical\njustification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling\nsubstantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate\nlightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion\nestablishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower\nlatency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On\n4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also\nuniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on\nslow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.\nCompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,\nand integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework.

This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined\nobjects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object\nDetection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only\nrecognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.\nTo this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal\nAxis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning\nenhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from\nthe auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained\ndetector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal\naxes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by\nestimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from\nmodel predictions.

However, existing\nmulti-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training\ntask to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents\nthe models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant\ntasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in\ncomplex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a\nMulti-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud\nunderstanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)\nToken-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing\nthe model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level\nreconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions\ndirectly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed\npoint cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning\n(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus\nassembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates\nwithout requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large\ndatasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various\ndownstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and\ngenerative applications under widely-used benchmarks."}

Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive\nlearning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment\nacross all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous\nalignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as\nlimitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from\noptimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this\npaper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel\nframework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without\nanchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the\ntheoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,\nPMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to\nalign modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based\nloss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest\nsingular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the\nleading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents\nrepresentation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate\nPMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be\npublicly available."}

Inspired by the principle of seeing both the\nforest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning\nframework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three\ncomplementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to\nperceive the entire scene (the \"forest\"), (2) Structural Evidence from a\nprototype-driven module to identify key objects (the \"trees\"), and (3) Causal\nEvidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly\ngrounded.
