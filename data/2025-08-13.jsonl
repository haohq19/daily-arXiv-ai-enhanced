In this work, we present an approach for\nimplementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that\nautomatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them\nin various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a\nspecific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text\nclustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on\nparticular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as\nin clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We\npresent an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in\nreal time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the\nproposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering\nalgorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text\nrepresentation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary\nfor story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling\napproaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story\ndiscovery.

To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for\nhandheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video.

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),\nthe first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically\ncapturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness."}

We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an\nLarge Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the\nrelevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach\nconsists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is\nsupported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and\nanalyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the\ngenerated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,\nincorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance\nrobustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach\nfor Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of\ntask-specific fine-tuning."}

This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less\nreliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can\neffectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.\nUnlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,\nAI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong\nsimilarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this\npaper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key\nchallenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation\nmodels, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core\nmodules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to\nunify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and\ncurriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more\ninformative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also\nfacilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.\nExtensive experiments on \\textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet\noutperforms SoTA approaches by \\textbf{6.3\\%}, highlighting its effectiveness\nin leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the\nincreasing realism of deepfakes."}
