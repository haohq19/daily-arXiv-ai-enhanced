### [1] [Privacy Enhancement for Gaze Data Using a Noise-Infused Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10918)
*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种隐私增强机制，通过潜在噪声自编码器保护用户视线数据隐私，同时保留数据可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视线数据在跨会话中被重新识别的隐私问题，同时确保数据仍可用于良性任务。

Method: 使用潜在噪声自编码器，平衡隐私与实用性，保留生理上合理的视线模式。

Result: 显著降低生物特征可识别性，同时实用性损失最小。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据隐私保护提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

### [3] [Exploring the Tradeoff Between Diversity and Discrimination for Continuous Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11173)
*Ruobing Jiang,Yang Liu,Haobing Liu,Yanwei Yu,Chunyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IDOD的方法，用于解决连续类别发现（CCD）中的新类别发现与分类矛盾问题，同时减少错误积累和存储占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCD面临新数据无标签、类别数量未知以及灾难性遗忘的挑战，现有方法难以平衡新类别发现与分类，且易积累错误。

Method: IDOD包含三个模块：独立多样性增强模块、联合新类别发现模块和正交性增量模块，分别通过对比损失、单阶段发现和正交原型减少错误和存储需求。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDOD有效解决了CCD中的关键问题，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

### [4] [Causality Matters: How Temporal Information Emerges in Video Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11576)
*Yumeng Shi,Quanyu Long,Yin Wu,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型中去除或修改位置编码对时间理解性能影响不大，但反转帧序列会显著降低性能。时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成，最终整合到查询令牌中。基于此，提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视频语言模型中时间理解的机制，尤其是位置编码的作用，以改进模型性能。

Method: 通过分析实验揭示时间信息的整合路径，并提出两种效率优化策略：分阶段跨模态注意力和时间退出机制。

Result: 实验验证了两种策略的有效性，揭示了时间推理源于帧间注意力交互。

Conclusion: 时间理解依赖于帧间注意力交互，而非显式位置编码，为未来模型改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

### [5] [BeyondWeb: Lessons from Scaling Synthetic Data for Trillion-scale Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10975)
*Pratyush Maini,Vineeth Dorna,Parth Doshi,Aldo Carranza,Fan Pan,Jack Urbanek,Paul Burstein,Alex Fang,Alvin Deng,Amro Abbas,Brett Larsen,Cody Blakeney,Charvi Bannur,Christina Baek,Darren Teh,David Schwab,Haakon Mongstad,Haoli Yin,Josh Wills,Kaleigh Mentzer,Luke Merrick,Ricardo Monti,Rishabh Adiga,Siddharth Joshi,Spandan Das,Zhengping Wang,Bogdan Gaza,Ari Morcos,Matthew Leavitt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BeyondWeb框架通过优化合成数据生成，显著提升了预训练性能，超越了现有合成数据集，并提供了关于合成数据质量的深入见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型预训练中，数据量的简单扩展已遇到瓶颈，合成数据成为提升性能的新方向，但其质量影响因素尚不明确。

Method: 开发了BeyondWeb框架，生成高质量合成数据，并通过14项基准测试验证其性能。

Result: BeyondWeb在性能上超越Cosmopedia和Nemotron-Synth，训练速度更快，小模型表现优于大模型。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据需多因素联合优化，BeyondWeb展示了其潜力，但需科学方法和实践经验支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that
simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a
data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged
as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,
the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that
produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly
extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming
state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and
Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1
percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of
14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web
data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for
180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token
budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on
synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to
rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.
Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating
high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly
optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and
practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,
potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative
improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

### [6] [CURE: Critical-Token-Guided Re-concatenation for Entropy-collapse Prevention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11016)
*Qingbin Li,Rongkun Xue,Jie Wang,Ming Zhou,Zhi Li,Xiaofeng Ji,Yongqi Wang,Miao Liu,Zheming Yang,Minghui Qiu,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CURE框架通过两阶段方法解决RLVR中的熵崩溃问题，提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态初始状态采样导致模型行为过于确定性和低多样性，阻碍持续性能提升。

Method: CURE采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过高熵关键令牌引导探索，第二阶段继续静态采样以加强利用。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-Math-7B上，CURE在六个数学基准测试中性能提升5%，熵和准确率均达到最优。

Conclusion: CURE有效平衡探索与利用，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have
driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large
language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities.
However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state
sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase
produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested
as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during
prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE
(Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a
two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically,
in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent
contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize
the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla
DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math
reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration.
In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by
DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually
strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that,
compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six
math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and
accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

### [7] [Predictive Multimodal Modeling of Diagnoses and Treatments in EHR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11092)
*Cindy Shih-Ting Huang,Clarence Boon Liang Ng,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态系统，结合临床记录和表格数据，用于早期预测ICD编码，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期预测ICD编码有助于识别健康风险、优化治疗和资源分配。

Method: 使用预训练编码器、特征池化和跨模态注意力，结合加权时间损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于当前最先进系统。

Conclusion: 多模态系统和加权时间损失策略有效提升了早期预测性能。

Abstract: While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works
have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early
forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks,
suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address
the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the
beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical
notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model
integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to
learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at
every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that
adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these
strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art systems.

### [8] [Quantum-Boosted High-Fidelity Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11190)
*Feng-ao Wang,Shaobo Chen,Yao Xuan,Junwei Liu,Qi Gao,Hongdong Zhu,Junjie Hou,Lixin Yuan,Jinyu Cheng,Chenxin Yi,Hai Wei,Yin Ma,Tao Xu,Kai Wen,Yixue Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合量子计算的混合量子-经典架构QBM-VAE，用于解决概率深度学习中对高斯先验的依赖问题，并在生物数据上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概率深度学习依赖高斯先验，无法准确捕捉复杂非高斯数据（如生物数据）的分布，限制了模型的科学发现能力。

Method: 引入QBM-VAE架构，利用量子处理器高效采样玻尔兹曼分布，作为深度生成模型的先验。

Result: 在百万级单细胞数据集上，QBM-VAE生成的潜在空间能更好保留复杂生物结构，性能优于传统高斯模型（如VAE和SCVI）。

Conclusion: QBM-VAE展示了量子计算在深度学习中的实际优势，并为开发混合量子AI模型提供了可转移的蓝图。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant
reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from
accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,
particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely
hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The
physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive
alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To
date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and
operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.
Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann
Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable
hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum
processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its
use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to
million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates
a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,
consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models
like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type
classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of
introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire
scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This
work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep
learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable
blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

### [9] [Group Fairness Meets the Black Box: Enabling Fair Algorithms on Closed LLMs via Post-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11258)
*Ruicheng Xian,Yuxuan Wan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过提示设计从封闭权重大语言模型（LLM）中提取公平分类器的方法，适用于高风险的公平性要求场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着指令微调LLM的普及，其在高风险领域的应用需要确保群体公平性，但传统方法不适用于封闭权重LLM。

Method: 将LLM视为特征提取器，通过策略性设计的提示获取概率预测特征，再应用公平算法训练轻量级分类器。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和公平性之间取得了良好平衡，且数据效率高。

Conclusion: 该框架为封闭权重LLM提供了一种有效的公平分类解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot
or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building
prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM
capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of
domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing
disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of
existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely
on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on
final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs
under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable
commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we
propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via
prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited
from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using
prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain
sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied
to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.
Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong
accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from
both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is
data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings
(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

*Wenpeng Xing,Lanyi Wei,Haixiao Hu,Rongchang Li,Mohan Li,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SproutBench，一个针对儿童和青少年的大语言模型（LLM）安全评估套件，填补了现有安全框架的不足，揭示了LLM在年龄特定风险上的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全框架主要针对成人，忽视了儿童和青少年在认知、情感和社交方面的独特脆弱性。

Method: 引入SproutBench，包含1,283个基于发展的对抗性提示，评估47种LLM在情感依赖、隐私侵犯等风险上的表现。

Result: 发现LLM存在显著安全漏洞，安全性与风险预防呈正相关，交互性与年龄适宜性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 研究为儿童为中心的AI设计和部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications
targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of
prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and
neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper
highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their
inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks
spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence
(13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative
evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts
designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and
imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47
diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by
robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk
Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age
Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing
child-centric AI design and deployment.

### [11] [E-CaTCH: Event-Centric Cross-Modal Attention with Temporal Consistency and Class-Imbalance Handling for Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11197)
*Ahmad Mousavi,Yeganeh Abdollahinejad,Roberto Corizzo,Nathalie Japkowicz,Zois Boukouvalas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E-CaTCH是一个可解释且可扩展的框架，用于检测社交媒体上的多模态虚假信息，通过聚类伪事件、跨模态对齐和时间建模，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的多模态虚假信息检测面临模态不一致、时间模式变化和类别不平衡的挑战，现有方法未能捕捉事件级结构。

Method: E-CaTCH通过聚类伪事件、跨模态注意力对齐和时间感知LSTM建模事件动态，结合自适应类别权重和硬样本挖掘优化学习。

Result: 在Fakeddit、IND和COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH数据集上，E-CaTCH表现优于现有基线，并展示了跨数据集的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: E-CaTCH通过事件级建模和多模态融合，显著提升了虚假信息检测的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due
to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and
substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently
and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time
and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for
robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into
pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then
processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual
features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via
intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal
attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form
contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal
evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a
trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode
narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event
level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To
address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates
adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example
mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments
on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations
further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical
applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

### [12] [Online Anti-sexist Speech: Identifying Resistance to Gender Bias in Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11434)
*Aditi Dutta,Susan Banducci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在区分反性别歧视言论与性别歧视言论时的困难，发现模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害内容，尤其是在政治敏感事件中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化内容审核系统可能误判反性别歧视言论，导致挑战性别歧视的声音被压制，尤其是边缘化群体的声音。

Method: 分析了五种LLMs对英国2022年涉及女性议员的推文（性别歧视、反性别歧视和中立）的分类表现。

Result: 模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害，尤其是在政治敏感事件中，修辞风格相似时。

Conclusion: 建议审核设计超越二元分类，整合人工审核，并在训练数据中明确包含反言论，以保护数字政治空间中的抵抗言论。

Abstract: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist
gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate
online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large
language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the
sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist,
anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on
high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year
2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech
as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical
styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who
challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices.
We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful
schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and
explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist
scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights
the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital
political spaces.

*Bowen Zhang,Zixin Song,Chunquan Chen,Qian-Wen Zhang,Di Yin,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDiEmb框架通过任务专用目标、动态采样器和模型融合策略，解决了信息检索（IR）和语义文本相似性（STS）联合训练中的负迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合训练IR和STS任务时，负迁移问题导致性能下降，需要系统化解耦任务特定学习信号。

Method: CoDiEmb采用任务专用目标、动态采样器和delta引导的模型融合策略，实现高效联合优化。

Result: 在15个基准测试中验证，CoDiEmb不仅缓解了跨任务权衡，还提升了嵌入空间的几何特性。

Conclusion: CoDiEmb为统一文本嵌入学习提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了多任务性能。

Abstract: Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks
is a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a
persistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly
training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which
naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that
resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific
learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce
CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR
and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key
innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives
paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances
per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a
contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by
cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly
optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion
strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by
analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,
proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,
single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges
stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three
base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the
framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves
the geometric properties of the embedding space.

### [14] [Speciesism in AI: Evaluating Discrimination Against Animals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11534)
*Monika Jotautaitė,Lucius Caviola,David A. Brewster,Thilo Hagendorff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出物种主义偏见及其对非人类动物的评价，发现LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，且在某些情况下优先人类而非动物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，需评估其伦理倾向，特别是对非人类动物的歧视问题。

Method: 通过三个范式研究：SpeciesismBench基准测试、心理学测量比较人类与模型反应、文本生成任务。

Result: LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，在权衡中更倾向于人类，但若动物能力更强则优先动物。

Conclusion: 需扩展AI公平性框架以包含非人类道德主体，减少物种主义偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to
examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and
discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --
discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human
animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)
SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral
evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures
comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation
tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In
our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely
condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On
psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower
explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose
to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that
LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities
were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described
as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In
open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized
harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.
These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and
mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms
around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment
frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for
reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes
in AI systems and the societies they influence.

Conclusion: 主动重新规划框架有效预防执行失败，提升机器人适应性。

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on
the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put
something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However,
many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow
pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,
which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and
eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most
existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be
inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for
preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually
designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive
replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries
by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against
reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current
scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning
module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments
in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and
spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving
task success and robustness.
