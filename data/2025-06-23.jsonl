Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

Published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable\n  and Secure Computing. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:2207.08159", "summary": "Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as\nintrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among\nmultiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for\ndownstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the\nevent-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric\nis appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and\nclustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised\nlearning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of\nevent-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the\nproposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution\nsequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively\nlearn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the\nobtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The\nproposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a\nsystematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of\nevent-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods considerably."}

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)\ntraining data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical\nMLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a\ncomprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths\ntowards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern\nCollaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to\ngenerate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor\nmodels to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each\nintern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally\nselects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning\nperformance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined\nby an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.\nEventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with\nranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum\nlearning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable\nreasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,\ntrained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning\nbenchmarks.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}
