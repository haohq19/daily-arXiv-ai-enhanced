However,\npartially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal\nupdates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.\nWe say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that\navoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,\ncorrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human\npreferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the\nexisting literature does not include specifications for goals that are both\ncorrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a\nformal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that\nconstructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,\nwithout sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting\npredictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then\nalso determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be\nmodified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by\ncorrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their\ngoals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be\nlearned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior."}
