Result: 在MITS数据集上微调后，主流大模型性能显著提升：LLaVA-1.5从0.494提升到0.905(+83.2%)，LLaVA-1.6从0.678到0.921(+35.8%)，Qwen2-VL从0.584到0.926(+58.6%)，Qwen2.5-VL从0.732到0.930(+27.0%)。

Conclusion: MITS数据集有效解决了智能交通监控领域的数据缺失问题，显著提升了大模型在该领域的性能，为ITS和LMM研究提供了高价值资源。

Abstract: General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant
advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the
Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the
absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce
MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale
multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes
170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic
surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories
of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions.
Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate
high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual
question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event
recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and
event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream
LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications.
Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in
ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905
(+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to
0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the
dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to
advance both ITS and LMM research.

### [2] [Segment Anything for Cell Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09943)
*Zhu Chen,Mert Edgü,Er Jin,Johannes Stegmaier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于SAM2的无监督细胞跟踪框架，免需手动标注和数据集特定调整，在2D和3D显微镜视频中实现竞争性跟踪精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决显微镜图像序列中细胞跟踪和有丝分裂检测的挑战，包括分裂物体、低信噪比、边界不明确、密集聚集等问题，同时避免依赖费时费力的手动标注数据集

Method: 通过将Segment Anything 2 (SAM2)大型基础分割模型集成到跟踪流程中，构建了一个完全无监督的跟踪框架，不依赖任何特定训练数据集

Result: 方法在2D和大规模3D时间拉显微镜视频中达到了竞争性的跟踪精度，同时消除了对数据集特定适配的需求

Conclusion: 该无监督方法免除了手动标注的成本和时间消耗，能够在各种异质性显微镜数据集上实现良好的通用性，为生物医学研究提供了一个强大的细胞跟踪解决方案

Abstract: Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image
sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly
challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct
boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual
cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets
for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their
generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity
of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell
tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation
model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking
pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or
inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize
across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves
competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos
while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇调查性论文系统总结了事件相机与传统框率相机融合的研究进展，重点分析了在视频恢复和3D重建任务中的深度学习方法，包括时间增强和空间增强两个维度，并提供了开放数据集资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机作为一种生物启发的传感器，具有低延迟、低功耗和超高抓抖率等优势，但需要与传统框率相机融合才能充分发挥其潜力。本文的动机是系统总结这种融合技术的发展进展和应用价值。

Method: 论文采用系统性调查方法，从两个维度全面评估深度学习在图像/视频增强恢复中的贡献：时间增强（如帧间插值、运动去模糊）和空间增强（包括超分辨率、低光和HDR增强、伪影减少），同时深入讨论3D重建领域的进展。

Conclusion: 通过整合最新进展和洞察，这份调查旨在激励进一步研究利用事件相机系统（特别是与深度学习结合）来实现高级视觉媒体恢复和增强，为该领域的未来发展指明方向。

Abstract: Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture
per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the
polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing
rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced
power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the
evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture,
highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration
and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep
learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on
two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion
deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and
HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D
reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion.
Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for
improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey
compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling
reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and
insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event
camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced
visual media restoration and enhancement.

### [4] [ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977)
*Siying Liu,Zikai Wang,Hanle Zheng,Yifan Hu,Xilin Wang,Qingkai Yang,Jibin Wu,Hao Guo,Lei Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISTASTrack是首个基于Transformer的ANN-SNN混合跟踪器，通过ISTA适配器实现RGB和事件数据的有效融合，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ANN网络难以充分利用事件流的稀疏和异步特性，而ANN-SNN混合架构在RGB-Event感知中显示出潜力，但跨异构范式的特征融合仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 采用双分支模型：视觉Transformer提取RGB空间上下文，脉冲Transformer捕获事件流时空动态。设计了基于ISTA算法的适配器进行双向特征交互，并加入时序下采样注意力模块对齐特征。

Result: 在FE240hz、VisEvent、COESOT和FELT等RGB-Event跟踪基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持高能效。

Conclusion: ISTASTrack证明了ANN-SNN混合设计在鲁棒视觉跟踪中的有效性和实用性，为跨模态特征融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to
leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike
events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks
(ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event
streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event
perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first
transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped
with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model
employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a
spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To
bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we
systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature
interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory
by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we
incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to
align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent
space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that
ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN
designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lsying009/ISTASTrack.git.

### [5] [GARD: Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising for Retinal OCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10341)
*Botond Fazekas,Thomas Pinetz,Guilherme Aresta,Taha Emre,Hrvoje Bogunovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GARD是一种基于伽马扩散模型的OCT图像去噪方法，通过噪声减少保真项和加速推理框架，在保持解剖结构的同时有效去除散斑噪声


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT图像存在固有的散斑噪声，传统方法难以在噪声去除和结构保持之间取得平衡，需要更准确的噪声统计模型和更好的去噪效果

Method: 采用去噪扩散伽马模型（DDGM）替代传统高斯假设，引入噪声减少保真项利用预处理图像指导去噪，并采用DDIM框架加速推理

Result: 在配对噪声/低噪声OCT数据集上，GARD在PSNR、SSIM和MSE指标上显著优于传统方法和先进深度学习模型，能产生更清晰的边缘并更好保留解剖细节

Conclusion: GARD通过伽马扩散模型和噪声减少保真项，成功解决了OCT图像去噪中噪声去除与结构保持的平衡问题，为视网膜疾病诊断提供了更高质量的图像

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing
and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by
speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation.
While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise
reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper
introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel
deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths
of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that
assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more
accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we
introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed,
less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents
the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process
by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based
model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans
demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods
and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better
preserves fine anatomical details.

TL;DR: HACO框架通过分离风险校准和偏好优化，为医疗补助人群提供保守、可审计的行动推荐，控制不良事件风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为医疗补助人群的健康管理项目提供安全、公平、可审计的决策支持，控制不良医疗事件风险

Method: 混合自适应符合离线强化学习框架：训练轻量级风险模型、推导符合阈值屏蔽不安全行动、在安全子集上学习偏好策略

Result: 实现了强大的风险区分能力（AUC约0.81），校准阈值在目标风险水平下保持高安全覆盖率，子组分析显示人口统计学差异

Conclusion: 符合风险门控与离线强化学习相结合，可为人口健康管理团队提供保守且可审计的决策支持

Abstract: Population health management programs for Medicaid populations coordinate
longitudinal outreach and services (e.g., benefits navigation, behavioral
health, social needs support, and clinical scheduling) and must be safe, fair,
and auditable. We present a Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline Reinforcement
Learning (HACO) framework that separates risk calibration from preference
optimization to generate conservative action recommendations at scale. In our
setting, each step involves choosing among common coordination actions (e.g.,
which member to contact, by which modality, and whether to route to a
specialized service) while controlling the near-term risk of adverse
utilization events (e.g., unplanned emergency department visits or
hospitalizations). Using a de-identified operational dataset from Waymark
comprising 2.77 million sequential decisions across 168,126 patients, HACO (i)
trains a lightweight risk model for adverse events, (ii) derives a conformal
threshold to mask unsafe actions at a target risk level, and (iii) learns a
preference policy on the resulting safe subset. We evaluate policies with a
version-agnostic fitted Q evaluation (FQE) on stratified subsets and audit
subgroup performance across age, sex, and race. HACO achieves strong risk
discrimination (AUC ~0.81) with a calibrated threshold ( {\tau} ~0.038 at
{\alpha} = 0.10), while maintaining high safe coverage. Subgroup analyses
reveal systematic differences in estimated value across demographics,
underscoring the importance of fairness auditing. Our results show that
conformal risk gating integrates cleanly with offline RL to deliver
conservative, auditable decision support for population health management
teams.

Motivation: 惊讶和惊吓事件会影响飞行员表现并带来安全风险，但现有研究缺乏对这两种反应的组合效应分析和生理区分方法

Method: 使用机器学习算法和多模态融合策略，基于生理信号来区分惊吓和惊讶事件

Result: 惊吓和惊讶事件可靠预测，SVM和后期融合策略达到85.7%准确率；包括基线状态的三分类任务中，XGBoost和后期融合达到74.9%准确率

Conclusion: 研究为风险环境中的惊吓和惊讶反应提供了可靠的生理区分方法，有助于提升安全性能和决策质量

Abstract: Unexpected events can impair attention and delay decision-making, posing
serious safety risks in high-risk environments such as aviation. In particular,
reactions like startle and surprise can impact pilot performance in different
ways, yet are often hard to distinguish in practice. Existing research has
largely studied these reactions separately, with limited focus on their
combined effects or how to differentiate them using physiological data. In this
work, we address this gap by distinguishing between startle and surprise events
based on physiological signals using machine learning and multi-modal fusion
strategies. Our results demonstrate that these events can be reliably
predicted, achieving a highest mean accuracy of 85.7% with SVM and Late Fusion.
To further validate the robustness of our model, we extended the evaluation to
include a baseline condition, successfully differentiating between Startle,
Surprise, and Baseline states with a highest mean accuracy of 74.9% with
XGBoost and Late Fusion.

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的飞机机翼疲劳寿命预测管道，替代传统复杂有限元模拟方法，实现快速准确预测并降低计算资源需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统飞机疲劳寿命预测方法耗时且复杂，需要多团队协作和大量有限元模拟，机器学习可以提供快速补充方案来提高效率

Method: 开发基于机器学习的管道，根据飞行参数预测飞机机翼不同位置的疲劳寿命，包含统计验证和不确定性量化

Result: 在真实疲劳寿命估计用例中验证有效，获得准确预测结果

Conclusion: 该机器学习管道是对传统方法的有效补充，能够显著减少昂贵模拟需求，降低计算和人力资源成本

Abstract: Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational
phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry
requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures.
Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety.
Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve
complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element
Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying
cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps
often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the
computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions.
Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life
estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing
quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the
fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters
of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its
operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue
life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical
validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a
complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly
simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human
resources.

Abstract: This paper presents boldsea, Boldachev's semantic-event approach -- an
architecture for modeling complex dynamic systems using executable ontologies
-- semantic models that act as dynamic structures, directly controlling process
execution. We demonstrate that integrating event semantics with a dataflow
architecture addresses the limitations of traditional Business Process
Management (BPM) systems and object-oriented semantic technologies. The paper
presents the formal BSL (boldsea Semantic Language), including its BNF grammar,
and outlines the boldsea-engine's architecture, which directly interprets
semantic models as executable algorithms without compilation. It enables the
modification of event models at runtime, ensures temporal transparency, and
seamlessly merges data and business logic within a unified semantic framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being recognised as valuable
knowledge communication tools in many industries. However, their application in
livestock farming remains limited, being constrained by several factors not
least the availability, diversity and complexity of knowledge sources. This
study introduces an intelligent knowledge assistant system designed to support
health management in farmed goats. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), two structured knowledge processing methods, table
textualization and decision-tree textualization, were proposed to enhance large
language models' (LLMs) understanding of heterogeneous data formats. Based on
these methods, a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base was established to
improve LLM's capacity for cross-scenario generalization. The knowledge base
spans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management,
Rearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge.
Additionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time
retrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six
ablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each
component. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method
achieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set
and 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree
based Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the
effectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error
analysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting
opportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration. In
conclusion, the results highlight the robustness and reliability of the
proposed system for practical applications in goat farming.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of robotic systems is paramount to
prevent potential disasters and safeguard human well-being. Despite rigorous
design and engineering practices, these systems can still experience
malfunctions, leading to safety risks. In this study, we present a machine
learning-based approach for detecting anomalies in system logs to enhance the
safety and reliability of robotic systems. We collected logs from two distinct
scenarios using CoppeliaSim and comparatively evaluated several machine
learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and an Autoencoder. Our system was evaluated in a quadcopter context
(Context 1) and a Pioneer robot context (Context 2). Results showed that while
LR demonstrated superior performance in Context 1, the Autoencoder model proved
to be the most effective in Context 2. This highlights that the optimal model
choice is context-dependent, likely due to the varying complexity of anomalies
across different robotic platforms. This research underscores the value of a
comparative approach and demonstrates the particular strengths of autoencoders
for detecting complex anomalies in robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper studies the kinematic tracking control problem for aerial
manipulators. Existing kinematic tracking control methods, which typically
employ proportional-derivative feedback or tracking-error-based feedback
strategies, may fail to achieve tracking objectives within specified time
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel control framework
comprising two key components: end-effector tracking control based on a
user-defined preset trajectory and quadratic programming-based reference
allocation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has
several attractive features. First, it ensures that the end-effector reaches
the desired position within a preset time while keeping the tracking error
within a performance envelope that reflects task requirements. Second,
quadratic programming is employed to allocate the references of the quadcopter
base and the Delta arm, while considering the physical constraints of the
aerial manipulator, thus preventing solutions that may violate physical
limitations. The proposed approach is validated through three experiments.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and its capability to guarantee that the target position is reached within the
preset time.
