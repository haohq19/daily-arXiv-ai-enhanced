Our work studies the\nalignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of\nunsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the\ninput prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after\ngeneration. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering\nboth prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there\nare no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful\nbehavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable\nfrom benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies\na natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All\nof our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In\naddition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation\napproaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that\nsafety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals\n(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not\nsuffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's\nintelligence cannot be separated from its judgment."}

Existing\nmethods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,\nclothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we\nexplore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a\nlightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID\nmodels. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that\nleverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI\nefficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while\ndisentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To\nachieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to\nprevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature\nspace. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color\nembeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when\nexplicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID\ndatasets.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive."}

In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative\ntraining, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information\nfrom devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data\ninformation, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it\nis necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal\ntransmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to\neach model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization\nproblem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while\nmeeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning\nframework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that\nenables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the\ndeceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models\nassigned to each model training device without knowing the position and\nmonitoring probability of eavesdroppers.

A common\napproach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;\nhowever, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.\nMoreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy\nadversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN\nperturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as\nbenign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These\nadversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success\nrates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based\nregret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based\ndetectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first\ninvestigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation\nby deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use\nprimarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly\napplying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,\nlimited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable\nExamples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on\nlarge-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on\nunlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure\nand thus ensuring training video data-privacy.

We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal\nVariational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for\nsurvival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,\nfour molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages\nmodality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,\nenabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific\ninformation. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically\nmeaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific\ninsights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed\nclinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,\ndata-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer\ncohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,\ndimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results\ndemonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard\nsurvival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our\nmodel achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal\nsurvival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning\narchitecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a\nspecific event, using both tabular and image data."}
