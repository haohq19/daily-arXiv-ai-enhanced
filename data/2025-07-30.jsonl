Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in\nregions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the\nMediterranean.

Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in\nregions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the\nMediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management\nstrategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this\ncontext, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence\nof wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This\nimbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional\nspatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning\narchitectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on\nweather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more\nfrequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This\npaper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these\nchallenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic\nfeatures. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive\nlearning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics\nand enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An\nexperimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed modeling strategies."}

While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and\nhonest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify\ndirections in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several\ntraits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm\nthat these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's\npersonality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and\ncontrol personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both\nintended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly\ncorrelated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be\nmitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a\nnew preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag\ntraining data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the\ndataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting\npersona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of\ninterest, given only a natural-language description."}

Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.\nThe README files should contain project-related information as per the\nrecommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.\nHowever, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.\nThis prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This\nresearch posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file\nsignificantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail\npotentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact\nwithin the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great\nperformance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text\ngeneration, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach\nis developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections\nof GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,\nDistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a\ngold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1\nscore of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without\ncompromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using\nLLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of\nGitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of\nautomated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and\npotential usages."}

A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the\nmodel's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change\nin the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the\nremaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable\nin a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available\n(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to\nfill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate\nthe inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)\nleveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform\nthe unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging\nzero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process\non the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling\nstrategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance\nafter unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and\nexperiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of\nour proposed method over several baselines."}

Many existing solutions rely on\ncomputationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency\nand are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as\nintelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent\naccidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph\nlearning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining\nhigh accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting\nstreaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark\ndetection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data\nprocessing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a\nfeature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network\nis then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low\nlatency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs\ncompetitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and\nlatency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the\ndevelopment of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems\nthat can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices."}
