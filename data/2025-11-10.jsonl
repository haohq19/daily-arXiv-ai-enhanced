Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality\nwhen predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to\noperate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by\nFourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the\ntemporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive\nWavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a\nFrequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by\nFast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a\nCoherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent\nfrequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through\ncross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency\nlocalization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate\nthat our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models.\nSpecifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared\nwith transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence\ntime series forecasting.

These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained\nfoundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are\ngrounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice\nmodel, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes\nthe master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive\ninteraction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in\neveryday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a\nSymbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and\nthe apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We\nformalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,\nwhere the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on\ninteraction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution\nto proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.\nTo realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial\nperception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds\nthe models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure\nstability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that\nprevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL\non both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction\nfollowing, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive\ndialogues.

However,\nemotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized\nemotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to\nobtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as \"win a prize\" and\n\"be criticized\". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of\nChinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by\nprompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To\nensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard\ninvalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being\npositive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we\nharvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment\npolarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of\nemotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that\nthe proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common\nChinese emotional events.
