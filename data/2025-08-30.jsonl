This study\nextends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,\naddressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of\nspatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a\nspatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's\nperspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive\ndatasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates\nYT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying\naudio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual\ncues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this\naim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a\nvision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical\ngeometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which\nfurther incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our\nresults on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,\ndemonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing\nmethods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these\nresults, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model\narchitecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional\nvideos.

However, thermal cameras encounter challenges\nwhen capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose\nsafety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving\nsystems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event\ncamera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven\neffective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the\ncomplementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes\nUTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage\nin low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and\nroadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and\nthe non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting\nmechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage\nrepresentation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to\nprovide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven\nevent signals.
