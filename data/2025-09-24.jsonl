In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and\nAnomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language\nmodels (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil\nmoisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced\nreasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis\nwithout requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting\ntime-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed\nprompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation\ngains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable\nreports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data\nfrom commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the\nUnited States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method\nin anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately\nclassifying anomaly types.

Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups.

To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions.

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions.

The official version will\n  appear in IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling\nenergy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN\ninference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy\nconstraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud\nco-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is\noften hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these\nissues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that\njointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a\nlearned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs\na dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on\noutput confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and\nCaltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To\ndemonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16\nbackbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data\ntransfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing\nend-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a\nnegligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables\npractical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained\nenvironments."}

The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse\nevolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection\ncapabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types\nof forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with\nlimited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned\nforgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant\nand relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously\nevolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical\ninfeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face\nforgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to\ndevelop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental\nMixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual\nexperts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and\nrefine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental\ninformation from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,\nwe ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the\nestablished subspace.

These have proven effective\nacross diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The\nstructure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly\nlearned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks.
