Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been\nexplored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such\ndeformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,\nextracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies\non costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent\neffective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING\n(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a\ndifferential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and\ntemporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the\nnetwork architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable\ntransformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D\nimages and 3D shapes.

However,\nlarge-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented\ntools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content\nwritten by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In\nrecent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large\nlanguage models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various\nnatural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from\ncrash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,\nfor example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100\ncategories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises\nprivacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools\noften underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support\nreasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging\nobjectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash\nType for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash\nnarratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject\ntask-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.\nExperiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation\nSampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models\noutperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal\ntraining resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can\ncapture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations\nin the dataset."}

While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap\nremains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive\nforecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,\ninterpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses\nthis gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,\nexplainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a\ntwo-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a\nreal-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model\nrepresents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events\n(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including\nplatform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the\nmodel is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting\nprotocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can\ncompound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is\nchallenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it\nachieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial\nadvantage for a reliable decision support tool."}

Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the\nfairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image\ndiagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked\nprognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression\nof a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,\nthe first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)\nprediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging\nmodalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and\nfairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness\nin medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE\nuncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical\nimaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive\nacross different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer\nlimited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between\nunderlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for\nholistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that\nfairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,\nunderscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for\nmore robust, equitable prognostic models."}

However, its vulnerability to\nadversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.\nAlthough existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from\nthree key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial\nattacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)\nthey have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but\ninstead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can\nintroduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack\nof robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent\nGeneral-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel\nrobust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted\nadversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is\ndesigned to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to\nexecute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it\nexplicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum\nobjective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to\ndevelop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To\nensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift\ncaused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.\nExtensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least\n27.9\\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to\nadversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based\nautonomous driving."}

For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling\nfamilies--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR\nand count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and\nanalyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness.

Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns\ncompact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized\nby normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this\nwork, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a\nconstant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.\nSpecifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a\nDeep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents\nrepresentational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit\nboth the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of\none-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment\nbetween negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or\nnon-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with\nVAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as\na drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.\nEmpirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and\nsubstantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model\nbackbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify\ntwo major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding\nand practical performance."}

The\nsignificant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG\narchitectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present\nCrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages\nacross 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than\n400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at\nassisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we\nstarted from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related\nto the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message.
