Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly\ncrucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid\nmulti-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph\nattention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance\ncolon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological\nImage Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the\nHG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points\nin transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale\nfeatures in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts\nglobal contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by\nconvolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a\ntransformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,\nlocal details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined\nwith a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust\ndiagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.\nResults show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also\nin these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders\nand realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures."}

Most existing spoofing\nattack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a\nsubstantial amount of training data.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.

These\ncapabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint\nmeasurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an\nautomated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in\nlook-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a\nfollow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this\nworkflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze\nclassification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and\nconvolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning\nalgorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these\nalgorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of\nmagnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument\ncompared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes."}

Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly\ncrucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid\nmulti-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph\nattention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance\ncolon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological\nImage Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the\nHG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points\nin transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale\nfeatures in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts\nglobal contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by\nconvolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a\ntransformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,\nlocal details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined\nwith a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust\ndiagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.\nResults show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also\nin these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders\nand realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures."}

Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through\ninstruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may\nsignificantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational\nresources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue\nthat knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable\nfor fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to\nfingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.\nDespite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being\noverwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale\nfine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning\n(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the\nfingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even\nin the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the\nfingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and\nsimilar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding\nunderscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting\ninjection methods for LLMs."}
