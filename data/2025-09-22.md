*Mahesh Shakya,Bijay Adhikari,Nirsara Shrestha,Bipin Koirala,Arun Adhikari,Prasanta Poudyal,Luna Mathema,Sarbagya Buddhacharya,Bijay Khatri,Bishesh Khanal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在资源受限环境中开发和部署AI辅助远程医疗和大规模筛查的实践经验，强调需要将AI开发和流程数字化视为端到端的迭代协同设计过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境中，视觉和听觉威胁性疾病导致可预防的残疾，但由于专家稀缺和筛查设备有限，大规模AI辅助筛查和远程医疗具有扩展早期检测的潜力，但实际部署面临挑战。

Method: 通过早期原型设计、影子部署和持续反馈的迭代跨学科合作，建立共享理解并减少从纸质工作流程过渡到AI就绪工作流程时的可用性障碍。

Result: 发现公共数据集和AI模型尽管因领域偏移而性能较差，但非常有用；需要自动化的基于AI的图像质量检查以在高质量营地中捕获可分级图像。

Conclusion: 通过记录这些实际挑战和经验教训，旨在填补在资源受限环境中构建真实世界AI辅助远程医疗和大规模筛查项目的上下文、可操作现场知识的空白。

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

### [2] [TennisTV: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Tennis Rallies?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15602)
*Zhongyuan Bao,Lejun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了TennisTV基准，这是首个用于网球视频理解的综合基准，通过评估16个代表性多模态大语言模型，揭示了在快速高频运动视频理解中的挑战和改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在一般视频理解方面表现出色，但在处理像网球这样的快速、高频运动时存在困难，因为网球回合片段短但信息密集。需要系统评估MLLMs在这一挑战性领域的表现。

Method: 构建TennisTV基准，将每个网球回合建模为时间有序的连续击球事件序列，使用自动化管道进行过滤和问题生成。基准涵盖8个任务，包含2,500个人工验证的问题。

Result: 评估16个代表性MLLMs发现存在显著不足，获得两个关键见解：(i)帧采样密度应根据任务进行定制和平衡；(ii)改进时间定位对于更强的推理能力至关重要。

Conclusion: TennisTV基准为网球视频理解提供了首个系统性评估，揭示了MLLMs在快速运动视频理解中的局限性，并指出了帧采样策略和时间定位能力改进的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips
are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this
challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive
benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a
temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated
pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger
reasoning.

### [3] [UNIV: Unified Foundation Model for Infrared and Visible Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15642)
*Fangyuan Mao,Shuo Wang,Jilin Mei,Chen Min,Shun Lu,Fuyang Liu,Yu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNIV是一个受生物学启发的统一基础模型，用于红外和可见光模态，通过注意力引导的对比学习和双知识保留机制，在保持RGB任务性能的同时显著提升红外任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-可见光和红外多模态感知中预训练模型性能不佳的问题，特别是在自动驾驶等需要多种传感器协同工作的场景中。

Method: 提出Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL)模拟视网膜水平细胞的侧向抑制机制，以及双知识保留机制模拟双极细胞信号路由，结合LoRA适配器和同步蒸馏。

Result: 在红外任务上语义分割提升1.7 mIoU，目标检测提升0.7 mAP，同时保持RGB任务99%以上的基线性能。

Conclusion: UNIV模型通过生物学启发的设计有效解决了多模态感知的挑战，为可见光和红外数据的统一处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at
https://github.com/fangyuanmao/UNIV.

### [4] [Saccadic Vision for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15688)
*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受人类扫视视觉启发的两阶段细粒度视觉分类方法，通过外围特征提取和注视点采样来解决现有基于部件方法的空间冗余问题，在多个标准数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于部件的细粒度分类方法存在空间冗余问题，复杂定位网络限制了特征在下游任务中的实用性，难以量化最优部件数量。受人类扫视视觉启发，需要更有效的特征采样机制。

Method: 两阶段过程：1）提取外围特征生成采样图；2）使用非极大值抑制采样注视点，通过权重共享编码器并行编码，应用上下文选择性注意力加权融合外围和注视表示。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011、NABirds、Food-101、Stanford-Dogs等标准数据集和EU-Moths、Ecuador-Moths、AMI-Moths等昆虫数据集上，方法达到与SOTA相当的性能，并持续优于基线编码器。

Conclusion: 提出的受人类视觉启发的两阶段方法有效解决了细粒度分类中的空间冗余问题，在不增加复杂性的情况下实现了竞争性性能，为细粒度视觉识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

### [5] [Hybrid Lie semi-group and cascade structures for the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15748)
*Tony Lindeberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉系统中感受野响应与图像变换之间的关系，提出了基于协变感受野族的方法来处理真实世界图像结构的变异性，并推导了空间和时空感受野响应在不同形状参数下的数学关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界图像结构在自然图像变换下存在变异性，导致视觉层次早期层的感受野响应受到几何图像变换的强烈影响。为了解决这种变异性，需要基于协变感受野族来扩展感受野形状以适应图像变换的自由度。

Method: 推导了空间和时空感受野响应在不同形状参数下的关系，包括：(i) 无穷小关系（结合半群和李群概念）和(ii) 宏观级联平滑特性（描述如何通过应用较小支持增量滤波器来计算粗尺度感受野响应）。

Result: 建立了感受野响应在不同滤波器参数下的数学关系，这些关系可用于设计更高效的多参数感受野族计算方案，并为生物视觉中简单细胞计算提供理想化理论模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对空间和时空感受野响应关系的理解，为设计高效计算方案和构建生物视觉理论模型提供了理论基础，有助于处理真实世界图像结构的变异性问题。

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

### [6] [Pre-Forgettable Models: Prompt Learning as a Native Mechanism for Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15230)
*Rutger Hendrix,Giovanni Patanè,Leonardo G. Russo,Simone Carnemolla,Giovanni Bellitto,Federica Proietto Salanitri,Concetto Spampinato,Matteo Pennisi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示的学习框架，将知识获取和移除统一在单一训练阶段中，通过将类别级语义绑定到专用提示标记来实现即时遗忘，无需重新训练或修改模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多媒体分析中表现出色，但其静态部署与日益增长的社会和监管需求（如GDPR要求的数据遗忘）存在冲突。传统遗忘方法计算成本高、脆弱且不适合实时系统。

Method: 采用基于提示的学习框架，将信息编码在提示标记而非模型权重中。通过移除对应提示标记即可实现即时遗忘，无需重新训练、模型修改或访问原始数据。

Result: 实验表明该框架在保留类别上保持预测性能，同时有效擦除遗忘类别。具有强大的隐私和安全保证，能抵抗成员推理攻击，防止残留知识提取。

Conclusion: 通过将可移除性嵌入架构本身，这项工作为设计模块化、可扩展和符合伦理的AI模型奠定了新基础，特别适合敏感和受监管环境部署。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed multimedia analysis by enabling robust and
transferable representations across diverse modalities and tasks. However,
their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands
-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by
privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,
including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often
computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or
continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:
rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in
capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies
knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than
encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics
to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by
removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or
access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves
predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten
ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security
guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal
prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.
This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against
unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for
deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding
removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new
foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models.

### [7] [Adversarial generalization of unfolding (model-based) networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15370)
*Vicky Kouni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对展开网络在对抗攻击下的泛化性能进行理论分析，提出了对抗Rademacher复杂度框架，并证明了与攻击水平相关的紧致泛化误差界。实验验证了理论结果，并发现过参数化可以提升对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展开网络在压缩感知等逆问题中应用广泛，但在对抗攻击下的理论理解尚不成熟。由于这些网络应用于医疗成像和密码学等关键领域，对抗鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: 选择最先进的过参数化展开网络家族，采用快速梯度符号方法生成l2范数约束的对抗攻击，部署新的对抗Rademacher复杂度估计框架来分析泛化性能。

Result: 推导出紧致于攻击水平的对抗泛化误差界，实验结果表明理论分析在所有真实数据上一致成立。发现过参数化可以被利用来提升对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这是首次对展开网络对抗泛化性能的理论分析，为如何有效增强神经网络对抗鲁棒性提供了新的见解和指导。

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative
algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to
solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering
data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in
critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial
robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid
theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the
presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we
study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with
$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.
Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized
unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial
Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial
generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with
respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further
present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating
our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the
family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial
robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

### [8] [Aircraft Fuel Flow Modelling with Ageing Effects: From Parametric Corrections to Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15736)
*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Junzi Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了将发动机老化效应整合到空客A320-214燃油流量预测中的多种方法，发现考虑老化因素能显著提高预测准确性，但受限于数据集规模和缺乏详细维护记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准参数模型通常忽略飞机老化导致的性能退化，而准确的燃油流量建模对运营规划和环境影响评估至关重要。

Method: 系统评估了基于物理的经典模型、经验修正系数以及数据驱动的神经网络架构，将年龄作为输入特征或显式乘法偏差。

Result: 基线模型持续低估老旧飞机的燃油消耗，而使用年龄相关修正因子和神经网络模型显著减少了偏差并提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在参数和机器学习框架中考虑老化效应的重要性，同时指出需要更多样化的数据集来捕捉真实世界发动机退化的复杂性。

Abstract: Accurate modelling of aircraft fuel-flow is crucial for both operational
planning and environmental impact assessment, yet standard parametric models
often neglect performance deterioration that occurs as aircraft age. This paper
investigates multiple approaches to integrate engine ageing effects into
fuel-flow prediction for the Airbus A320-214, using a comprehensive dataset of
approximately nineteen thousand Quick Access Recorder flights from nine
distinct airframes with varying years in service. We systematically evaluate
classical physics-based models, empirical correction coefficients, and
data-driven neural network architectures that incorporate age either as an
input feature or as an explicit multiplicative bias. Results demonstrate that
while baseline models consistently underestimate fuel consumption for older
aircraft, the use of age-dependent correction factors and neural models
substantially reduces bias and improves prediction accuracy. Nevertheless,
limitations arise from the small number of airframes and the lack of detailed
maintenance event records, which constrain the representativeness and
generalization of age-based corrections. This study emphasizes the importance
of accounting for the effects of ageing in parametric and machine learning
frameworks to improve the reliability of operational and environmental
assessments. The study also highlights the need for more diverse datasets that
can capture the complexity of real-world engine deterioration.

### [9] [Incremental Multistep Forecasting of Battery Degradation Using Pseudo Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15740)
*Jonathan Adam Rico,Nagarajan Raghavan,Senthilnath Jayavelu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出iFSNet模型，用于在线增量多步电池寿命预测，通过伪目标解决现有方法无法实时校正和需要大量数据重训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型多为离线模式，需要在新数据分布出现时重新训练，无法适应在线增量学习需求，且多步预测难以实时校正。

Method: 改进FSNet为单通模式，使用线性回归器从输入序列外推伪未来样本作为伪目标，结合FSNet的联想记忆和自适应结构机制进行增量学习。

Result: 在平滑退化轨迹数据集上RMSE为0.00197、MAE为0.00154；在具有容量再生尖峰的不规则退化轨迹数据集上RMSE为0.01588、MAE为0.01234。

Conclusion: iFSNet能够有效实现在线增量多步预测，在不同退化模式下均表现出良好性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Data-driven models accurately perform early battery prognosis to prevent
equipment failure and further safety hazards. Most existing machine learning
(ML) models work in offline mode which must consider their retraining
post-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there
is a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying
distributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a
great challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the
current instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of
time to acquire enough streaming data before retraining. In this study, we
propose iFSNet (incremental Fast and Slow learning Network) which is a modified
version of FSNet for a single-pass mode (sample-by-sample) to achieve multistep
forecasting using pseudo targets. It uses a simple linear regressor of the
input sequence to extrapolate pseudo future samples (pseudo targets) and
calculate the loss from the rest of the forecast and keep updating the model.
The model benefits from the associative memory and adaptive structure
mechanisms of FSNet, at the same time the model incrementally improves by using
pseudo targets. The proposed model achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on
datasets with smooth degradation trajectories while it achieved 0.01588 RMSE
and 0.01234 MAE on datasets having irregular degradation trajectories with
capacity regeneration spikes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种自动分析和追踪在线材料中极端主义或恐怖主义相关言论的方法，使用机器学习分类和时间追踪技术


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要自动检测和追踪在线极端主义和恐怖主义言论，以帮助安全分析

Method: 使用通用句子编码器提取特征，SVM分类器进行检测，并采用时间追踪算法分析态度变化

Result: 极端主义检测准确率81%，恐怖主义检测准确率97%，优于基于n-gram的基线系统

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测极端主义意图和态度，并能追踪时间趋势和重大事件引起的态度突变

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for automatically analysing and tracking
statements in material gathered online and detecting whether the authors of the
statements are likely to be involved in extremism or terrorism. The proposed
system comprises: online collation of statements that are then encoded in a
form amenable to machine learning (ML), an ML component to classify the encoded
text, a tracker, and a visualisation system for analysis of results. The
detection and tracking concept has been tested using quotes made by terrorists,
extremists, campaigners, and politicians, obtained from wikiquote.org. A set of
features was extracted for each quote using the state-of-the-art Universal
Sentence Encoder (Cer et al. 2018), which produces 512-dimensional vectors. The
data were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier
using 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect
intentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and
terrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was
higher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on
n-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal
analysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a
person's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were
able to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could
be attributed to major events.

### [11] [BiRQ: Bi-Level Self-Labeling Random Quantization for Self-Supervised Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15430)
*Liuyuan Jiang,Xiaodong Cui,Brian Kingsbury,Tianyi Chen,Lisha Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiRQ是一个双层自监督学习框架，结合了BEST-RQ的效率和HuBERT风格标签增强的优势，通过重用模型自身作为伪标签生成器，实现端到端的标签优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音自监督学习中伪标签生成的核心挑战：强标签（如HuBERT）性能好但依赖外部编码器和多阶段流程，而高效方法（如BEST-RQ）简单但标签质量较弱。

Method: 提出双层SSL框架，使用随机投影量化器将中间表示离散化生成增强标签，同时从原始输入直接派生的锚定标签稳定训练。采用可微Gumbel-softmax选择的一阶双层优化问题，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在多个数据集（960小时LibriSpeech、150小时AMI会议和5000小时YODAS）上验证，相比BEST-RQ获得持续改进，同时保持低复杂度和计算效率。

Conclusion: BiRQ消除了对外部标签编码器的需求，降低了内存成本，实现了端到端的迭代标签优化，在保持效率的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Speech is a rich signal, and labeled audio-text pairs are costly, making
self-supervised learning essential for scalable representation learning. A core
challenge in speech SSL is generating pseudo-labels that are both informative
and efficient: strong labels, such as those used in HuBERT, improve downstream
performance but rely on external encoders and multi-stage pipelines, while
efficient methods like BEST-RQ achieve simplicity at the cost of weaker labels.
We propose BiRQ, a bilevel SSL framework that combines the efficiency of
BEST-RQ with the refinement benefits of HuBERT-style label enhancement. The key
idea is to reuse part of the model itself as a pseudo-label generator:
intermediate representations are discretized by a random-projection quantizer
to produce enhanced labels, while anchoring labels derived directly from the
raw input stabilize training and prevent collapse. Training is formulated as an
efficient first-order bilevel optimization problem, solved end-to-end with
differentiable Gumbel-softmax selection. This design eliminates the need for
external label encoders, reduces memory cost, and enables iterative label
refinement in an end-to-end fashion. BiRQ consistently improves over BEST-RQ
while maintaining low complexity and computational efficiency. We validate our
method on various datasets, including 960-hour LibriSpeech, 150-hour AMI
meetings and 5,000-hour YODAS, demonstrating consistent gains over BEST-RQ.

### [12] [SciEvent: Benchmarking Multi-domain Scientific Event Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15620)
*Bofu Dong,Pritesh Shah,Sumedh Sonawane,Tiyasha Banerjee,Erin Brady,Xinya Du,Ming Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciEvent是一个新的多领域科学信息提取基准，通过统一的事件提取模式对科学摘要进行标注，旨在实现结构化且上下文感知的科学内容理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统科学信息提取主要依赖窄领域的实体关系提取，限制了在跨学科研究中的应用，且难以捕捉科学信息的必要上下文，常导致碎片化或冲突的陈述。

Method: 将科学信息提取定义为多阶段事件提取流程：(1) 将摘要分割为核心科学活动（背景、方法、结果、结论）；(2) 提取相应的触发词和细粒度参数。

Result: 通过微调的事件提取模型、大语言模型和人工标注者的实验显示存在性能差距，当前模型在社会学和人文科学等领域表现不佳。

Conclusion: SciEvent作为一个具有挑战性的基准，是朝着可泛化、多领域科学信息提取迈出的一步。

Abstract: Scientific information extraction (SciIE) has primarily relied on
entity-relation extraction in narrow domains, limiting its applicability to
interdisciplinary research and struggling to capture the necessary context of
scientific information, often resulting in fragmented or conflicting
statements. In this paper, we introduce SciEvent, a novel multi-domain
benchmark of scientific abstracts annotated via a unified event extraction (EE)
schema designed to enable structured and context-aware understanding of
scientific content. It includes 500 abstracts across five research domains,
with manual annotations of event segments, triggers, and fine-grained
arguments. We define SciIE as a multi-stage EE pipeline: (1) segmenting
abstracts into core scientific activities--Background, Method, Result, and
Conclusion; and (2) extracting the corresponding triggers and arguments.
Experiments with fine-tuned EE models, large language models (LLMs), and human
annotators reveal a performance gap, with current models struggling in domains
such as sociology and humanities. SciEvent serves as a challenging benchmark
and a step toward generalizable, multi-domain SciIE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法需要明确的目标句子，不支持更广泛的概念（如人物、事件）遗忘，存在局限性。

Method: 利用知识图谱表示LLM内部知识，通过生成知识三元组和解释性句子，将遗忘过程与LLM内部知识表示对齐。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效实现概念级遗忘，同时保留无关知识。

Conclusion: 提出的概念遗忘方法解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更精确和全面的概念移除。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) has recently attracted considerable attention as a
solution to privacy and copyright issues in large language models (LLMs).
Existing MU methods aim to remove specific target sentences from an LLM while
minimizing damage to unrelated knowledge. However, these approaches require
explicit target sentences and do not support removing broader concepts, such as
persons or events. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept Unlearning
(CU) as a new requirement for LLM unlearning. We leverage knowledge graphs to
represent the LLM's internal knowledge and define CU as removing the forgetting
target nodes and associated edges. This graph-based formulation enables a more
intuitive unlearning and facilitates the design of more effective methods. We
propose a novel method that prompts the LLM to generate knowledge triplets and
explanatory sentences about the forgetting target and applies the unlearning
process to these representations. Our approach enables more precise and
comprehensive concept removal by aligning the unlearning process with the LLM's
internal knowledge representations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method effectively achieves concept-level
unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge.

Abstract: We present Sym2Real, a fully data-driven framework that provides a principled
way to train low-level adaptive controllers in a highly data-efficient manner.
Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor
and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning.
Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to
real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct
application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to
unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often
shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we
strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world
residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar
platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six
out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across
five real-world conditions. More information and videos can be found at at

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential
for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous
racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC
cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation
methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or
require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight
approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies
solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special
dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip
events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions,
and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under
no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across
different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results
closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the
potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for
real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown
scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may
encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects,
temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent
human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however
can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is
severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks,
especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This
paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance
framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication.
It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration
and intermittent communication (called the "spread mode"), where the robots
collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet
and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay
topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles
(called the "relay mode"), such that all requested assistance can be provided
with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the
robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator
adaptively. Extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments
are performed over numerous challenging scenes.
