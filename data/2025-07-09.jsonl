Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality\nprevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we\nexplore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating\nCFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two\ndatasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public\ndataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as\nDiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high\nplausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive\nsparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves\ndownstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially\nin low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative\ntechniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and\nphysiological prediction tasks.

These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide\ntext or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works\nignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within\nand between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new\nclasses remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an\nIntegrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of\ninformation representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces\nself-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural\nrelationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across\nmodalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving\nfeature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that\ndynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing\nthe mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization\nability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:\nbase-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization\ndemonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against\nstate-of-the-art methods."}

Code:\n  https://github.com/wangbing1416/DAEDCMD", "summary": "Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely\nspread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,\nthe social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the\ngeneralization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to\nremember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific\nparameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and\nanticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time\ndynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and\nsignificantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and\nthree continual learning methods."}
