Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their\nreliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture\nthe dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,\nexisting attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit\nlimitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and\nadaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal\nflood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present\nXFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through\nadvanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:\n(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically\naligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity\ninteractions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous\nConvolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages\nfrequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention\nto extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral\nand spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature\nRefinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive\nscaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood\ndetection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as\nChennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,\nsurpassing existing methods by significant margins."}

To address this, we\nintroduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be\nresistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary\nhypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nweights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender\nLLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these\nadversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment.

In\ncontrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and\nthat popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases\nfrom transferring.

By keeping an event camera\nstatic and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we\ncreate a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame\nis that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is\nprocessed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation\nof the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared\nacross error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.\nCombined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced\ncomputation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy\nconsumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility\nof event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all\ncode and data used to generate our results:\nhttps://gitlab.kitware.com/nest-public/telescope_accuracy_quantification."}

To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic\nassistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.\nHowever, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical\ntraining data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of\nmemorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it\noccurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is\nmemorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect\nmedical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:\n(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard\nmedical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including\nover 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The\nresults demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation\nscenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.\nMemorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and\ncan be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of\nclinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated\ndisclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,\nregeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these\nfindings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial\nmemorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,\nminimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond\nsurface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the\nleakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information."}

Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides\ncritical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation\nintroduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure\nresolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log\nlabeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data\nwithout manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of\nanomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies\ninto three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,\nAnomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a\nflexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,\nand supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show\nF1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third\nlayer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,\ntheir origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying\nkey services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of\nroot cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable\ninsights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be\ndesigned and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By\nintegrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust\nmethods to enhance IT system reliability."}

We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time\nmethod that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its\ncontext window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,\neach processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating\nthe output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a\nricher set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We\ntheoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla\nscaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving\nperformance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various\nmodel architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and\nEventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves\nperformance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.\nSelf-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a\nmemory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning\ncapabilities of VideoLLMs."}

We invalidate this assumption by studying the\nBTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely\npopular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In\ncontrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and\nthat popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases\nfrom transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and\nthose after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and\ntasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age\n(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we\nfind that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition\nparameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational\ndistribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several\nprompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have\ndistinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,\ntasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and\npotentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent\npropagation of biases to downstream tasks."}
