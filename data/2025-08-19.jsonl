This version is a pre-MIT Press publication\n  version", "summary": "Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\npreventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

This naturally leads to a\ndiscussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and\nannotation.

To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a\ntwo-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on\nsequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,\nSEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized\nrepresentations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and\nbalance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation\n(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more\ngeneralized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD\nfor effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the\nefficacy of its components.

Extrinsic calibration is a critical prerequisite for\neffective sensor fusion; however, the configuration that involves event cameras\nremains an understudied topic. In this paper, we propose a motion-based\ntemporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric\nmulti-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets.\nOur method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event\ncameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from\nconventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method\nefficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are\nderived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration\npipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset\nand rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and\nrotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a\ncontinuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both\npublicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed\nmethod achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while\nexhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting\nits precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our\nimplementation will be made open-source. Code:\nhttps://github.com/NAIL-HNU/EvMultiCalib."}

This version is a pre-MIT Press publication\n  version", "summary": "Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\npreventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.
