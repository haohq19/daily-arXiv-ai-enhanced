Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model\ndesign strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a\ncontemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating\nMLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based\nmisinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different\narchitectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection\nmethods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic\ndetection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new\ncontent to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable\ninsights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation\ndetection. The code and data have been released."}

Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their\nassociated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention\nthrough specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the\nneed to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological\nadvancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.\nMainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that\ncombines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech\nanalysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions\nare described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with\ninterpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance\nand natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all\nevaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.\nUltimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their\nassociated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and\nintervention."}

This paper introduces Semantic Divergence\nMetrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness\nHallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input\ncontexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we\ntest for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not\nonly across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent\nparaphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,\n$\\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein\ndistance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a\nFaithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence\nKL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \\textbf{Semantic\nExploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.\nThese metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic\nframework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,\nconfident confabulation."}

Existing defenses, including host\nbased patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited\nscalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with\nembedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch\nvalidation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning\nFrom Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.\nREFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven\nby online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN\nguarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways\n(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real\nnetwork traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22\nfamilies of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1\npercent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of\n3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an\ninitial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n\nday exploitations."}
