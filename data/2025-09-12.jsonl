Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable.

We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode.

Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that\npatches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance\non dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion\nby involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict\nspatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,\ni.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure\ninter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for\ndense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.\nThese observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for\ndense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill\nthe patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we\npropose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average\nPrecision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and\nadaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.\nSecond, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose\nthe object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.\nSpecifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via\ncross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks\nsoundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in\nhttps://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP."}

Yet, their integration with\nnatural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in\nmultimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.\nBuilt on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,\n13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring\nexpressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --\nappearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects\n-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This\nattribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,\nenabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual\nreasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for\nadvancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications\nspanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on."}

We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing\nsophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous\nconvection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression\nTasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric\nforecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields\noptimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs\ndual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,\nphysically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present\nfour key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap\nacross multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the \"IVT Paradox\", removing\nIntegrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric\nriver analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)\narchitectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART\nachieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent\nCSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding\ndisaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to\nsystematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,\nwith no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our\nvalidation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently\ndemonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise\noperational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on\nstandard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological\nworkflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather\npreparedness."}
