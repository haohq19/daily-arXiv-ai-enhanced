This is\nespecially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by\nperiodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains\nvaluable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer\nsome mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical\ndata for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply\nstoring and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating\nall historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying\nrelevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated\nusing a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation\nof previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,\ninvolving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently\nimproves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative\nobject detection frameworks."}

In particular, collecting such extensive data\nintraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses\nthis challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative\ndata to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.\n  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera\nviewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.\nIntraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the\npre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically\ncombining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables\nthe creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.\n  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.\nQuantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope\nimages demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics\nindicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared\nwith ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,\nconfirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.\n  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF\ntraining in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional\nmulti-view methods."}

CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect\nrelationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer\ndecisions.
