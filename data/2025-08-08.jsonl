To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time\naround 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers\nfeel they made the biggest impact on the robot."}

Accurate and robust segmentation\nmodels are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision\nmaking across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in\nimage characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of\ngeneralizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.\nThis model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for\nmodality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major\nchallenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT\nvs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these\nissues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables\nmultimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method\nintegrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module\nthat harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local\ntraining. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset\nand a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was\ninitially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its\nperformance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT\ndata were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data\nscenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test\ncases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.\nIn the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized\nperformance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a\n10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong\ncross-modality generalization under privacy constraints."}

Survival\nanalysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts\nfor patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study\nperiod, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events\nthat prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks\nare often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a\nlimited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates\nwhy treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in\nsurvival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,\ncritically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of\nmisclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in\nsurvival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error\nand demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and\nalgorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles\nacross demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially\nexacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical\nanalysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing\nrisks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,\npotentially accentuating inequity.

It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers\nto guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise\ngrounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning.
