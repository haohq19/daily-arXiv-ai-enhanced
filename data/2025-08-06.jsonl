The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM.

In this work, we propose an\nultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on\nresource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a\nnovel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples\npositive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.\nFurthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss\n(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity\nconsistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance\non multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference\ntime. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or\nusing it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks."}

However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:\nspecific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,\nboth of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and\nassociation (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each\ninstance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a\ndistribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the\ncurrent domain into the domain-specific representations with the different\ndomain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,\nwe propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the\nunified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further\nmitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)\nmechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly\nmodel inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,\ndistribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current\ndomain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,\nimproving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms\nthe existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be\npublicly released."}

In the present work, we propose\nevTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face\nexpression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a\nfeature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,\nbuilt by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem\n(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to\nthe face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer\nlearning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions\ncompared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an\narchitecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression\ndynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as\nTIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed\nframework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to\nstate-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework\nevTransFER achieves a 93.6\\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,\nsignificantly improving the accuracy (25.9\\% points or more) when compared to\nstate-of-the-art performance for similar problems."}
