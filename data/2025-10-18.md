### [1] [Event Interval Modulation: A Novel Scheme for Event-based Optical Camera Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14245)
*Miu Sumino,Mayu Ishii,Shun Kaizu,Daisuke Hisano,Yu Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专为事件相机光学通信设计的新型调制方案——事件间隔调制(EIM)，通过调制事件间隔来提升传输速度，在室内环境中实现了28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的传输速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的相机OCC系统存在比特率低和处理负载高的问题，而现有事件相机OCC系统使用的传统调制方案未能充分利用事件相机的独特特性。

Method: 提出事件间隔调制(EIM)方案，通过调制事件间隔来编码信息；优化事件相机参数以适配EIM；实验确定最大可用调制阶数；基于获得的参数进行传输实验。

Result: 成功在室内环境中实现28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的传输，创下了事件相机OCC系统的比特率新纪录。

Conclusion: EIM方案能够充分利用事件相机的异步特性，显著提升事件相机OCC系统的传输性能，为高速可见光通信提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

*Liao Shen,Wentao Jiang,Yiran Zhu,Tiezheng Ge,Zhiguo Cao,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IPRO框架，通过强化学习优化扩散模型，解决图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当人脸在图像中占比较小且表情动作变化大时，人类对身份变化高度敏感。

Method: 基于强化学习的视频扩散框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化模型，通过反向传播奖励信号和KL散度正则化稳定训练。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需改变模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Envision an AI capable of functioning in human-like settings, moving beyond
mere observation to actively understand, anticipate, and proactively respond to
unfolding events. Towards this vision, we focus on the innovative task where,
given ego-streaming video input, an assistant proactively answers diverse,
evolving questions at the opportune moment, while maintaining synchronized
perception and reasoning. This task embodies three key properties: (1)
Proactive Coherence, (2) Just-in-Time Responsiveness, and (3) Synchronized
Efficiency. To evaluate and address these properties, we first introduce
ESTP-Bench (Ego Streaming Proactive Benchmark) alongside the ESTP-F1 metric-a
novel framework designed for their rigorous assessment. Secondly, we propose a
comprehensive technical pipeline to enable models to tackle this challenging
task. This pipeline comprises: (1) a data engine, (2) a multi-stage training
strategy, and (3) a proactive dynamic compression technique. Our proposed model
effectively addresses these critical properties while outperforming multiple
baselines across diverse online and offline benchmarks. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和剪枝时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性。长视频经常超出现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: 引入高效视频采样(EVS)，识别并剪枝时间上静态的补丁——在连续帧间保持不变的空间区域。该方法保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS显著减少令牌数量，同时保持语义保真度，使推理速度更快，输入序列更长。在推理时应用，EVS将大型语言模型的首令牌时间减少高达4倍，准确率损失最小。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-准确度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

### [6] [MoCom: Motion-based Inter-MAV Visual Communication Using Event Vision and Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14770)
*Zhang Nengbo,Hann Woei Ho,Ye Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉运动信号的MAV蜂群通信框架，模仿蜜蜂摇摆舞，使用四种运动基元传递信息，通过事件相机和SNN进行解码，实现低功耗可靠通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV蜂群中面临频谱拥塞、干扰和高功耗问题，需要寻找替代通信方式。

Method: 使用四种运动基元（上下、左右、左-上-右、左-下-右）作为控制符号，通过事件相机捕获运动模式，采用事件帧分割模型和轻量级SNN进行动作识别和解码。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV蜂群提供了一种节能的替代通信方案，在受限环境中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

### [7] [Exploratory Causal Inference in SAEnce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14073)
*Tommaso Mencattini,Riccardo Cadei,Francesco Locatello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Neural Effect Search的无监督因果效应发现方法，通过预训练基础模型和稀疏自编码器从试验数据中自动发现未知的因果效应，解决了传统随机对照试验依赖人工假设和昂贵分析的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机对照试验是科学的重要支柱，但依赖人工假设和昂贵分析，限制了因果效应估计的规模，可能导致固守流行但不完整的假设。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将非结构化试验数据转化为有意义的表示，通过稀疏自编码器进行解释，并引入Neural Effect Search递归程序通过渐进分层解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题。

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，并在实验生态学背景下首次成功实现了真实世界科学试验中的无监督因果效应识别。

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，突破了传统随机对照试验的限制，为大规模因果效应估计提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

*Mayank Keoliya,Seewon Choi,Rajeev Alur,Mayur Naik,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，发现现有方法在准确性和稳定性之间难以平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期事件预测系统忽视风险评分的时间稳定性，且主要基于表格数据评估，缺乏对多模态输入下风险轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 在六个预测任务中，现有方法特别是LLMs难以同时优化准确性和稳定性，在高精度操作点召回率表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

### [9] [SHaRe-SSM: An Oscillatory Spiking Neural Network for Target Variable Modeling in Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14386)
*Kartikay Agrawal,Abhijeet Vikram,Vedant Sharma,Vaishnavi N.,Ayon Borthakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（尖峰谐波共振放电状态空间模型），一种用于超长序列建模的乘法自由、能量高效的二阶尖峰状态空间模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合尖峰神经网络（SNNs）的能量效率和状态空间模型（SSMs）在长序列建模中的优势，为资源受限应用开发高效的序列建模方法。

Method: 设计二阶尖峰SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，并首次提出基于核的尖峰回归器用于超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比二阶ANN-based SSMs节省73倍能量，在50k序列上仍保持优异性能，平均表现优于transformer和一阶SSMs。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM在保持性能的同时显著降低能耗，是资源受限应用中长序列建模的有力替代方案。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

*Guanting Dong,Licheng Bao,Zhongyuan Wang,Kangzhi Zhao,Xiaoxi Li,Jiajie Jin,Jinghan Yang,Hangyu Mao,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou,Yutao Zhu,Ji-Rong Wen,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过动态熵平衡机制解决Agentic RL中过度依赖熵信号导致的训练崩溃问题，在14个数据集上优于7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流Agentic RL算法过度依赖熵信号来引导探索高不确定性工具调用步骤，但过度依赖熵会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监控自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并引入熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO一致优于7种主流RL算法。仅使用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B模型在GAIA上达到47.6% Pass@1和65.0% Pass@5，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2% Pass@1和26.0% Pass@5，在WebWalker上达到43.0% Pass@1和70.0% Pass@5。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性同时保持稳定的策略熵，有助于可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Conclusion: 该框架为神经形态无线传感器网络提供了一种有效的在线异常检测解决方案，在保持低功耗的同时确保了检测的可靠性和时效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G多RAT网络中传统切换机制反应式、事件触发，依赖瞬时测量，在快速信道动态、干扰和异构覆盖下可靠性不足，需要更智能的预测性切换方案。

Method: 提出模型驱动、短时域信号质量预测的ML辅助预测性条件切换框架，使用RAT感知LSTM网络预测移动用户信号质量指标，采用滞后条件决策逻辑，支持软硬切换设置。

Conclusion: 提出的P-CHO框架能够实现准确、低延迟、主动的切换，适合6G多RAT部署中的ML辅助切换控制。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体间通信协议碎片化导致语义鸿沟，无法进行严格的系统属性分析，存在架构错位和可被利用的协调问题等风险。

Method: 引入两个基础模型：主机智能体模型（负责与用户交互、任务分解和协调执行）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务从创建到完成的状态转换）。

Conclusion: 这是首个严格基础、领域无关的框架，用于系统分析、设计和部署正确、可靠、鲁棒的多智能体AI系统。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像预测文化遗产退化程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现76.9%准确率，比标准多模态方法提升43%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测无法捕捉环境应力与材料退化间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 基于PerceiverIO的轻量多模态架构，采用简化编码器（64D潜在空间）防止小数据集过拟合，并使用自适应Barlow Twins损失促进模态互补性。

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比单模态方法（传感器61.5%，图像46.2%）表现更好。

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的遗产监测中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Method: 通过温和介绍推理捷径，直观讨论其成因和后果，回顾现有理论特征，详细阐述包括缓解和意识策略在内的应对方法，并分析其优缺点。

Result: 提供了推理捷径的统一视角，降低了研究者解决这一问题的门槛，有助于开发可靠的神经符号AI和可信AI模型。

Conclusion: 通过重新表述高级材料使其易于理解，本综述旨在为推理捷径提供统一视角，促进可靠神经符号AI和可信AI模型的发展。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

### [16] [Serialized EHR make for good text representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13843)
*Zhirong Chou,Quan Qin,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对医疗领域的预训练基础模型，通过将电子健康记录序列化来更好地捕捉临床事件间的时序依赖关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格和事件性质与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，限制了捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 通过基于结构化EHR序列的额外预训练扩展SciBERT，设计SerialBEHRT模型来编码临床事件间的时间和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的EHR表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 医疗领域基础模型预训练中时序序列化的重要性得到验证，SerialBEHRT能够产生更丰富的患者表示。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

*Siying Liu,Shisheng Zhang,Indu Bala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在药物安全预测中存在系统性偏见，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测概率，存在显性和隐性两种偏见模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在生物医学领域应用时是否会将社会人口学信息纳入临床无关的不良事件预测，评估其可靠性。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据和基于角色的评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B模型在不同社会人口特征和用户角色下的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测概率，识别出显性偏见（推理中直接引用角色属性）和隐性偏见（预测不一致但未提及角色）。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重风险，临床部署前迫切需要公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了Qwen3Guard系列安全护栏模型，包含生成式和流式两个变体，支持多语言和细粒度安全分类，解决了现有模型无法适应不同安全策略和实时监控的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两个主要限制：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，无法与流式推理兼容。

Method: 开发了两个专门变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转换为指令跟随任务，实现细粒度三分类；流式Qwen3Guard引入token级分类头，支持实时安全监控。提供三种规模（0.6B、4B、8B），支持119种语言。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全审核解决方案，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: 提出了Beyond One World基准测试，用于评估LLM在角色扮演中忠实呈现特定版本角色的能力，包含30个英雄的90个版本，测试事实回忆和道德困境处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在角色扮演中难以忠实、一致地呈现版本特定角色，特别是像漫威和DC这样的超级英雄宇宙中不同版本的角色具有不同历史、价值观和道德准则。

Method: 构建包含30个标志性英雄和90个特定版本角色的基准测试，包含两个任务：Canon Events（事实回忆）和Moral Dilemmas（道德困境），并提出了Think-Act Matching指标来量化推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：(1)思维链提示能改善较弱模型的叙事连贯性，但可能降低较强模型的准确性；(2)角色内跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；(3)模型通常在思考或行动中表现优异，但很少两者兼得。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时适应框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署中常因分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，难以应用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：预填充阶段和定期间隔时，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；正常生成文本时保持修改后的路由器。通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上获得一致性能提升，例如在OLMoE上HumanEval提升5.5%；与自一致性等技术结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效优化MoE路由决策，保持计算效率，防止过度适应，且具有即插即用特性，可与现有测试时缩放技术自然互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.
