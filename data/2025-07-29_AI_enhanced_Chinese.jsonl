In automated mode, the framework can randomly\nsample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,\nallowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets.

Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery\ntrajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and\nresilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral\ncontrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and\nhighly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional\nflood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides\nthe temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a\nhierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this\nchallenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial\nmulti-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and\nbare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between\nspectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites.

Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases.

Although some methods\nintegrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player\nidentities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent\nof the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt\ngeneration network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which\nfocuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.\nSpecifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is\ndesigned to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a\nplayer identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player\nnames, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player\nfeatures with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual\ncontext learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context\ninformation. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the\nmultimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the\ngeneration of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we\nconstruct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware\nbasketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event\ntypes. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate\nthat our proposed model achieves advanced performance.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses\non events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded\nand use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our\nmethod on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that\noverlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,\nresulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for\nimage reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision\nalgorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth\nestimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\\%$ performance improvement over\nother de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing\nthe reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,\npaving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u53bb\u96ea\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96ea\u82b1\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6062\u590d\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u53bb\u96ea\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u56e0\u5176\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7279\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u7406\u60f3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u96ea\u82b1\u7684\u6761\u7eb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u70b9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728PSNR\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd53 dB\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5168\u5929\u5019\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
