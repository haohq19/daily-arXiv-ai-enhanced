The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17\nproperties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into\nliveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,\nthese properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of\ncoordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security\nvulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously\ngrounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and\ndeployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems."}

To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an\nevent-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS\nenables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its\nasynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC\nsystems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse\nposition modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,\nno modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique\ncharacteristics of the EVS.

This issue becomes critical when the human\nface occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly\nsensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored\nchallenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving\nReward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on\nreinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation.

Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,\nQwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response\nsafety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for\npublic use."}

Handover in multi-RAT deployments is\nstill highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous\nmeasurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning\n(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a\nmodel-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a\ngeneralized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,\nwhich standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision\nlogic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a\nrealistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along\nrandomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated\nunder different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated\ncoverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under\ndifferent system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO\nvariants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.\nFinally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,\nshowing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover\nfailures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable\naccurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted\nhandover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments."}

For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial\ninto meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret\nthem via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects\nat the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects\nentanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a\nnovel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.\nAfter assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,\nwe showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful\nunsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial."}

While existing test-time adaptation methods\ncould potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models\nand require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to\nMoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,\nwe can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As\nsuch, we propose \\textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that\ncontinuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without\nexternal supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the\nprefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing\ndecisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated\nsequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router\nuntil the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors\nthat only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational\nefficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show\nconsistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining\nrobustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\\%\nimprovement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play\nproperty, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling\ntechniques, e.g., achieving 6\\% average gains when incorporated with\nself-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite."}

As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for\nreliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural\nand symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping\nlow-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning\ninfers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior\nknowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the\nconcepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning\nShortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the\nconcepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's\nexplanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore\nreliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless\nconcept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the\nliterature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and\npractitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview\naddresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing\ntheir causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and\nelucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,\nit details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness\nstrategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced\nmaterial in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying\nperspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we\nhope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and\ntrustworthy AI models."}
