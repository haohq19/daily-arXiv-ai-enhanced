Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale\ndataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view\nand all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because\nthere are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33\nvideos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with\na complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a\nplatform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in\ncomplex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple\nSOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the\nfoundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:\nhttps://github.com/loseevaya/CrowdTrack ."}

Project page: https://lgcnsai.github.io/apt", "summary": "Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant\nchallenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of\ntext alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction\ndistribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose\nsemantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training\n(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive\ntraining strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations\nduring fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training\nAdjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of\noverfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and\nadaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation\nStabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature\nmaps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention\nAlignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention\nmaps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain\nprior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior\nknowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse\nimages with limited reference data."}

Manual\ndetection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to\nhuman error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current\nstudy addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning\narchitecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural\ncrack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net\nmodels were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine\ndetails, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising\nconvolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction\nefficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's\nperformance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet\nand the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models\noutperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and\nthe ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as\nthe most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union\n(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest\nscores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more\nreliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks."}

L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \\b{eta}-VAE, wherein\nthe hyperparameter, \\b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the\nlimitations of \\b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the\nloss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and\nreconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and\nthe parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An\nadditional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias\ntowards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses\nshow that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction\nfidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed\nL-VAE against \\b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\\sigma}-VAE on\ndatasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that\nL-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured\nby a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on\nCelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the\nfacial attributes."}
