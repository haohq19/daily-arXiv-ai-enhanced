SAMEP implements a\ndistributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic\naccess controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing\nagent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness\nacross diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare\nAI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines.

To address this, we introduce\nThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages\nto dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.\nThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most\nimportant attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient\ncertainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates\nthe input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which\nconditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous\nstage, enabling progressive improvement.

Recent works like van Krieken et\nal. (2024) and Marconato et al.

There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy\ncommunity around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually\nlimits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle\nthis question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic\nconcepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain\nconcept combinations.

This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient\nframework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)\nalgorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.\n  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier\nremoval techniques across multiple public datasets.\n  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly\navailable datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.\nSince these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted\ntheir segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the\nrobustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation\nand remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors\nand a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a\nfast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for\nreal-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern\naugmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.\n  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,\nachieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5\nof 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a\nregularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional\nregularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing."}

To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets.
