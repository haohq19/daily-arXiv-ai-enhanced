This limitation, analogous to cognitive functional fixedness, prevents agents from restructuring their approach, leading them to pursue unworkable solutions. To address this, we propose PPoGA (Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action), a novel KGQA framework inspired by human cognitive control and problem-solving. PPoGA incorporates a Planner-Executor architecture to separate high-level strategy from low-level execution and leverages a Predictive Processing mechanism to anticipate outcomes. The core innovation of our work is a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to perform not only Path Correction for local execution errors but also Plan Correction by identifying, discarding, and reformulating the entire plan when it proves ineffective. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging multi-hop KGQA benchmarks: GrailQA, CWQ, and WebQSP. The results demonstrate that PPoGA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our work highlights the critical importance of metacognitive abilities like problem restructuring for building more robust and flexible AI reasoning systems."}

However, within these multi-agent systems, the susceptibility of agents to collective cognitive biases remains an underexplored issue. A compelling example is the Mandela effect, a phenomenon where groups collectively misremember past events as a result of false details reinforced through social influence and internalized misinformation. This vulnerability limits our understanding of memory bias in multi-agent systems and raises ethical concerns about the potential spread of misinformation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the Mandela effect in LLM-based multi-agent systems, focusing on its existence, causing factors, and mitigation strategies. We propose MANBENCH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agent behaviors across four common task types that are susceptible to the Mandela effect, using five interaction protocols that vary in agent roles and memory timescales. We evaluate agents powered by several LLMs on MANBENCH to quantify the Mandela effect and analyze how different factors affect it. Moreover, we propose strategies to mitigate this effect, including prompt-level defenses (e.g., cognitive anchoring and source scrutiny) and model-level alignment-based defense, achieving an average 74.40% reduction in the Mandela effect compared to the baseline.

The reconstruction-based methods appeal because they have basic architectural design and they process data quickly but they produce oversmoothed results for high-frequency details. As a result, subtle defects are partially reconstructed rather than highlighted, which limits segmentation accuracy. We build on this line of work and introduce D3R-Net, a Dual-Domain Denoising Reconstruction framework that couples a self-supervised 'healing' task with frequency-aware regularization. During training, the network receives synthetically corrupted normal images and is asked to reconstruct the clean targets, which prevents trivial identity mapping and pushes the model to learn the manifold of defect-free textures. In addition to the spatial mean squared error, we employ a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude loss that encourages consistency in the frequency domain. The implementation also allows an optional structural similarity (SSIM) term, which we study in an ablation. On the MVTec AD Hazelnut benchmark, D3R-Net with the FFT loss improves localization consistency over a spatial-only baseline: PRO AUC increases from 0.603 to 0.687, while image-level ROC AUC remains robust. Evaluated across fifteen MVTec categories, the FFT variant raises the average pixel ROC AUC from 0.733 to 0.751 and PRO AUC from 0.417 to 0.468 compared to the MSE-only baseline, at roughly 20 FPS on a single GPU.

We compare multiple machine learning approaches for mortgage default prediction using a real-world loan-level dataset, with emphasis on leakage control and imbalance handling. We employ leakage-aware feature selection, a strict temporal split that constrains both origination and reporting periods, and controlled downsampling of the majority class.

Conventional learning approaches often struggle to separate task-relevant features from domain-specific variations (e.g., lighting, field-of-view, and rotation), leading to poor sample efficiency and catastrophic failure in unseen environments. To bridge this gap, we propose ContrAstive Prompt Orchestration (CAPO), a novel approach for learning visuomotor policies that integrates contrastive prompt learning and adaptive prompt orchestration. For prompt learning, we devise a hybrid contrastive learning strategy that integrates visual, temporal action, and text objectives to establish a pool of learnable prompts, where each prompt induces a visual representation encapsulating fine-grained domain factors. Based on these learned prompts, we introduce an adaptive prompt orchestration mechanism that dynamically aggregates these prompts conditioned on current observations. This enables the agent to adaptively construct optimal state representations by identifying dominant domain factors instantaneously. Consequently, the policy optimization is effectively shielded from irrelevant interference, preventing the common issue of overfitting to source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Crucially, it exhibits superior zero-shot adaptation across unseen target domains characterized by drastic environmental (e.g., illumination) and physical shifts (e.g., field-of-view and rotation), validating its effectiveness as a viable solution for cross-embodiment visuomotor policy adaptation."}

A physics-informed Health Index, derived from transmembrane pressure, flux, and resistance, captures degradation dynamics, which are then fuzzified via Gaussian membership functions. Using a similarity measure, the model identifies historical degradation trajectories resembling the current state and formulates RUL predictions as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. Each rule corresponds to a historical exemplar and contributes to a transparent, similarity-weighted RUL estimate. Tested on 12,528 operational cycles from an industrial-scale UF system, the framework achieved a mean absolute error of 4.50 cycles, while generating interpretable rule bases consistent with expert understanding."}

In many robot-wire interaction tasks, contact occurs not at the end-effector but at other points along the robot's body. Such scenarios arise when robots manipulate wires indirectly (e.g., by nudging) or when wires act as passive obstacles in the environment. Accurately identifying these interactions is crucial for safe and efficient trajectory planning, helping to prevent wire damage, avoid restricted robot motions, and mitigate potential hazards. Existing approaches often rely on expensive external force-torque sensor or that contacts occur at the end-effector for accurate force estimation. Using wire shape information acquired from a depth camera and under the assumption that the wire is in or near its static equilibrium, our method estimates both the location and magnitude of external forces without additional prior knowledge. This is achieved by exploiting derived consistency conditions and solving a system of linear equations based on force-torque balance along the wire. The approach was validated through simulation, where it achieved high accuracy, and through real-world experiments, where accurate estimation was demonstrated in selected interaction scenarios."}

Based on these observations, HyLRA employs an offline dynamic programming approach to derive an optimal layer-wise policy. This hybrid strategy retains full attention for sensitive layers to ensure robustness, while enabling tolerant layers to bypass quadratic calculations by directly reusing top-$k$ indices from preceding layers. This approach allows LLMs to restrict computation to the most critical tokens, effectively overcoming the quadratic bottleneck of dense attention.

Breeden"], "title": "How Understanding Forecast Uncertainty Resolves the Explainability Problem in Machine Learning Models", "comment": "22 pages; 2 figures", "summary": "For applications of machine learning in critical decisions, explainability is a primary concern, and often a regulatory requirement. Local linear methods for generating explanations, such as LIME and SHAP, have been criticized for being unstable near decision boundaries. In this paper, we explain that such concerns reflect a misunderstanding of the problem. The forecast uncertainty is high at decision boundaries, so consequently, the explanatory instability is high. The correct approach is to change the sequence of events and questions being asked. Nonlinear models can be highly predictive in some regions while having little or no predictability in others. Therefore, the first question is whether a usable forecast exists. When there is a forecast with low enough uncertainty to be useful, an explanation can be sought via a local linear approximation. In such cases, the explanatory instability is correspondingly low. When no usable forecast exists, the decision must fall to a simpler overall model such as traditional logistic regression. Additionally, these results show that some methods that purport to be explainable everywhere, such as ReLU networks or any piecewise linear model, have only an illusory explainability, because the forecast uncertainty at the segment boundaries is too high to be useful. Explaining an unusable forecast is pointless."}

However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space."}

Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors.

For example, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are often confined to single-wheel tests, which obscures coupled wheel-vehicle-controller interactions and prevents joint optimization of mechanical design and control. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization framework that co-designs rover wheel geometry and steering controller parameters using high-fidelity, full-vehicle closed-loop simulations on deformable terrain. Using the efficiency and scalability of a continuum-representation model (CRM) for terramechanics, we evaluate candidate designs on trajectories of varying complexity while towing a fixed load. The optimizer tunes wheel parameters (radius, width, and grouser features) and steering PID gains under a multi-objective formulation that balances traversal speed, tracking error, and energy consumption. We compare two strategies: simultaneous co-optimization of wheel and controller parameters versus a sequential approach that decouples mechanical and control design. We analyze trade-offs in performance and computational cost. Across 3,000 full-vehicle simulations, campaigns finish in five to nine days, versus months with the group's earlier DEM-based workflow. Finally, a preliminary hardware study suggests the simulation-optimized wheel designs preserve relative performance trends on the physical rover. Together, these results show that scalable, high-fidelity simulation can enable practical co-optimization of wheel design and control for off-road vehicles on deformable terrain without relying on prohibitively expensive DEM studies.

Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data.

To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models."}

However, these defenses often focus on analyzing explicit textual inputs or relevant visual scenes. In this work, we introduce Text-DJ, a novel jailbreak attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting the model's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability. Our methodology consists of three stages. First, we decompose a single harmful query into multiple and semantically related but more benign sub-queries. Second, we pick a set of distraction queries that are maximally irrelevant to the harmful query. Third, we present all decomposed sub-queries and distraction queries to the LVLM simultaneously as a grid of images, with the position of the sub-queries being middle within the grid. We demonstrate that this method successfully circumvents the safety alignment of state-of-the-art LVLMs. We argue this attack succeeds by (1) converting text-based prompts into images, bypassing standard text-based filters, and (2) inducing distractions, where the model's safety protocols fail to link the scattered sub-queries within a high number of irrelevant queries. Overall, our findings expose a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' OCR capabilities that are not robust to dispersed, multi-image adversarial inputs, highlighting the need for defenses for fragmented multimodal inputs."}

We present a formal analysis of how alignment from human feedback can increase this failure mode by identifying an explicit amplification mechanism that causally links optimization against a learned reward to bias in the human preference data used for alignment. We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty. Computational experiments find that reward gaps are common and cause behavioral drift in all the configurations considered."}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that extends LLM-based TPPs to the visual modality, positioning text generation as a core capability alongside time and type prediction. Our approach addresses the long-context problem through an adaptive sequence compression mechanism based on temporal similarity, which reduces sequence length while preserving essential patterns. We employ a two-stage paradigm of pre-training on compressed sequences followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks.

However, deploying them as autonomous \"Clinical Agents\" remains limited. Current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and standards like FHIR are designed for human review, creating a \"Context Mismatch\": AI agents receive fragmented data and must rely on probabilistic inference (e.g., RAG) to reconstruct patient history. This approach causes hallucinations and hinders auditability. Methods: We propose MedBeads, an agent-native data infrastructure where clinical events are immutable \"Beads\"--nodes in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)--cryptographically referencing causal predecessors. This \"write-once, read-many\" architecture makes tampering mathematically detectable. We implemented a prototype with a Go Core Engine, Python middleware for LLM integration, and a React-based visualization interface. Results: We successfully implemented the workflow using synthetic data. The FHIR-to-DAG conversion transformed flat resources into a causally-linked graph. Our Breadth-First Search (BFS) Context Retrieval algorithm traverses relevant subgraphs with O(V+E) complexity, enabling real-time decision support. Tamper-evidence is guaranteed by design: any modification breaks the cryptographic chain. The visualization aids clinician understanding through explicit causal links. Conclusion: MedBeads addresses the \"Context Mismatch\" by shifting from probabilistic search to deterministic graph traversal, and from mutable records to immutable chains, providing the substrate for \"Trustworthy Medical AI.\" It guarantees the context the AI receives is deterministic and tamper-evident, while the LLM determines interpretation. The structured Bead format serves as a token-efficient \"AI-native language.\" We release MedBeads as open-source software to accelerate agent-native data standards."}

This contextual data, crucial for domain experts to classify vehicle failures, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and the noisy nature of real-world data. This paper presents BiCarFormer: the first multimodal approach to multi-label sequence classification of error codes into error patterns that integrates DTC sequences and environmental conditions. BiCarFormer is a bidirectional Transformer model tailored for vehicle event sequences, employing embedding fusions and a co-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between diagnostic codes and environmental data. Experimental results on a challenging real-world automotive dataset with 22,137 error codes and 360 error patterns demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to models that rely solely on DTC sequences and traditional sequence models.

This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations.

We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time.

This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines.

In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios."}

Most existing foundation models (FMs) for event stream data flatten this hierarchy into a one-dimensional sequence, leading to (i) computational inefficiency associated with dense attention and learning spurious within-set relationships, and (ii) lower-quality set-level representations from heuristic post-training pooling for downstream tasks. Here, we show that preserving the original hierarchy in the FM architecture provides a useful inductive bias that improves both computational efficiency and representation quality.

Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO.

Across multiple datasets, downstream tasks, and model architectures, this objective consistently yields more generalizable representations than next-token prediction and pretraining losses that ignore continuous measurements.

We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families.

To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions.

SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines."}

Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning. Our approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining practical deployability for real-world smart-home systems."}

However, this paradigm suffers from two critical challenges: Structural Degeneration, where hierarchical and semantic representations are entangled, and Optimization Instability, which arises from oscillatory dynamics of minimax adversarial training. To tackle these issues, we propose DisRFM, a geometry-aware GDA framework that unifies Riemannian embedding and flow-based transport. First, to overcome structural degeneration, we embed graphs into a Riemannian manifold. By adopting polar coordinates, we explicitly disentangle structure (radius) from semantics (angle). Then, we enforce topology preservation through radial Wasserstein alignment and semantic discrimination via angular clustering, thereby preventing feature entanglement and collapse. Second, we address the instability of adversarial alignment by using Riemannian flow matching. This method learns a smooth vector field to guide source features toward the target along geodesic paths, guaranteeing stable convergence. The geometric constraints further guide the flow to maintain the disentangled structure during transport. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic stability of the flow matching and derive a tighter bound for the target risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisRFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect.

To address this, we propose PPoGA (Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action), a novel KGQA framework inspired by human cognitive control and problem-solving. PPoGA incorporates a Planner-Executor architecture to separate high-level strategy from low-level execution and leverages a Predictive Processing mechanism to anticipate outcomes.

We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets.

Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word \"cat\"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads."}

With data privacy regulations, access to many original datasets is restricted, especially medical images. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by enabling global model aggregation without data exchange. However, the heterogeneity of the data and the class imbalance that exist in local clients pose challenges for the generalization of the model. This study proposes a FL framework leveraging a dynamic adaptive focal loss (DAFL) and a client-aware aggregation strategy for local training. Specifically, we design a dynamic class imbalance coefficient that adjusts based on each client's sample distribution and class data distribution, ensuring minority classes receive sufficient attention and preventing sparse data from being ignored. To address client heterogeneity, a weighted aggregation strategy is adopted, which adapts to data size and characteristics to better capture inter-client variations. The classification results on three public datasets (ISIC, Ocular Disease and RSNA-ICH) show that the proposed framework outperforms DenseNet121, ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-L/32, FedCLIP, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and MixNet in most cases, with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.98\\% to 41.69\\%.

Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data.

Recent work by Ortiz-Jimenez et al. (2023) showed that fine-tuning can be viewed in a model's tangent space, where linearized updates act as additive vectors that can be composed to jointly perform well on multiple tasks. Building on this formulation, we extend this idea to preference alignment and propose Tangent-Space Direct Preference Optimization (TS-DPO), which performs DPO within this locally linear regime to learn per-objective update directions. These directions can be linearly combined at inference to generate user-specified behaviors without additional optimization. Evaluated on the helpfulness-verbosity trade-off using the HelpSteer and UltraFeedback datasets, TS-DPO achieves broader Pareto-optimal coverage and smoother preference control than scalarized DPO. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) further shows that tangent-space training amplifies canonical directions aligned with distinct preferences, improving disentanglement."}

Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO.

We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space."}

We introduce a quantitative measure of watermark strength that governs statistical detectability and is maximized when tokens are deterministic functions of pseudorandom numbers. Using this measure, we fully characterize the trade-off as a constrained optimization problem and derive explicit Pareto curves for two existing watermarking schemes. Finally, we introduce a principled mechanism that injects pseudorandomness into draft-token acceptance, ensuring maximal watermark strength while maintaining speculative sampling efficiency.

However, these defenses often focus on analyzing explicit textual inputs or relevant visual scenes. In this work, we introduce Text-DJ, a novel jailbreak attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting the model's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability. Our methodology consists of three stages. First, we decompose a single harmful query into multiple and semantically related but more benign sub-queries. Second, we pick a set of distraction queries that are maximally irrelevant to the harmful query. Third, we present all decomposed sub-queries and distraction queries to the LVLM simultaneously as a grid of images, with the position of the sub-queries being middle within the grid. We demonstrate that this method successfully circumvents the safety alignment of state-of-the-art LVLMs. We argue this attack succeeds by (1) converting text-based prompts into images, bypassing standard text-based filters, and (2) inducing distractions, where the model's safety protocols fail to link the scattered sub-queries within a high number of irrelevant queries. Overall, our findings expose a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' OCR capabilities that are not robust to dispersed, multi-image adversarial inputs, highlighting the need for defenses for fragmented multimodal inputs."}

We evaluate agents powered by several LLMs on MANBENCH to quantify the Mandela effect and analyze how different factors affect it.

Current approaches in this domain present a clear trade-off: PPO-style methods (e.g., GRPO/DAPO) offer training stability but exhibit slow learning trajectories due to their trust-region constraints on policy updates, while REINFORCE-style approaches (e.g., CISPO) demonstrate improved learning efficiency but suffer from performance instability as they clip importance sampling weights while still permitting non-zero gradients outside the trust-region. To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models."}

Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence.

To address these, we introduce FlashTrace, an efficient multi-token attribution method that employs span-wise aggregation to compute attribution over multi-token targets in a single pass, while maintaining faithfulness. Moreover, we design a recursive attribution mechanism that traces importance through intermediate reasoning chains back to source inputs. Extensive experiments on long-context retrieval (RULER) and multi-step reasoning (MATH, MorehopQA) tasks demonstrate that FlashTrace achieves over 130x speedup over existing baselines while maintaining superior faithfulness.

First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights.

In this work, we propose a framework for counterfactual validation of TLP models by generating causal temporal interaction graphs (CTIGs) with known ground-truth causal structure. We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models. Finally, we instantiate counterfactual evaluation under (i) controlled causal shifts between generating models and (ii) timestamp shuffling as a stochastic distortion with measurable causal distance. Our framework provides a foundation for causality-aware benchmarking."}

While classical survival models such as Cox remain widely adopted in standard practice, they rely on restrictive assumptions, including linear covariate relationships and proportional hazards over time, that often fail to capture real-world clinical dynamics. Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood. Our architecture preserves interpretability through learnable univariate functions that indicate how individual features influence risk over time. Extensive experiments on standard survival benchmarks demonstrate that SurvKAN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art baselines across concordance and calibration metrics.

Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines."}

Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy.

Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping.

To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models."}

Given a set of vision tokens-such as images, point clouds, videos, or event camera streams-our objective is to encode their positions while accounting for the characteristics of vision modalities. Prior works have largely extended position encodings from 1D-sequences in language to nD-structures in vision, but only with partial account of vision characteristics. We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets. Extrapolation experiments on ImageNet-1K show that PaPE extrapolates remarkably well, improving in absolute terms by up to 10.5% over the next-best position encoding.

Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines."}

Existing decoding methods, such as contrastive decoding (CD), rely on random perturbations to construct contrastive data for mitigating hallucination patterns. However, such a way is hard to control the visual cues that drive hallucination or well align with model weaknesses. We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families. The method is especially effective in challenging scenarios involving small, occluded, or co-occurring objects. Our code and data will be publicly released."}

However, exhaustive sequential reading is structurally misaligned with sparse and discontinuous genomic semantics, leading to wasted computation on low-information background and preventing understanding-driven compression for long contexts. Here, we present OpticalDNA, a vision-based framework that reframes genomic modeling as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-style document understanding. OpticalDNA renders DNA into structured visual layouts and trains an OCR-capable vision--language model with a \\emph{visual DNA encoder} and a \\emph{document decoder}, where the encoder produces compact, reconstructible visual tokens for high-fidelity compression. Building on this representation, OpticalDNA defines prompt-conditioned objectives over core genomic primitives-reading, region grounding, subsequence retrieval, and masked span completion-thereby learning layout-aware DNA representations that retain fine-grained genomic information under a reduced effective token budget. Across diverse genomic benchmarks, OpticalDNA consistently outperforms recent baselines; on sequences up to 450k bases, it achieves the best overall performance with nearly $20\\times$ fewer effective tokens, and surpasses models with up to $985\\times$ more activated parameters while tuning only 256k \\emph{trainable} parameters."}

When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera."}
