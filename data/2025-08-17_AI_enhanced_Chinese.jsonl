However, their\nperformance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as\nindustrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and\ndifficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data\n(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than\nthese detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications.

AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\uff08AKI\uff09\uff0cLightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u809d\u786c\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u4e2dAKI\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u878d\u5165ICU\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u63d0\u53d648\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08AUROC 0.808\uff09\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u809d\u786c\u5316-AKI\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4bAKI\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\u964d\u7ea7\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task.
