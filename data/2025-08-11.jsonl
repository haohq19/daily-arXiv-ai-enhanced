In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On\nhistorical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant\noverall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both\nhistorical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal\nif not higher overall collision risk guarantees."}

Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks.

However, most of the\ncurrent approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete\ncoverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence\nduring inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the\nquality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a\nvariational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action\ntrajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the\ntraining data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a\nseries of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried\nout, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control\npolicy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that\nthe proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data\nefficiency."}

Traditional anomaly\ndetection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level\nbehavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches\nbased on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time\nrequirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal\nbehavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.\nThis framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic\ndescriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses\nadjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term\ncontexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event\nsubjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal\nactivity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset\nthat provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,\nsummary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets\nand offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety\nscenarios."}

Although\ncurrent video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are\ncapable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies\ndue to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the\nredundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these\nchallenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of\nVison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose\nVA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in\nvarious videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual\nencoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token\nSelection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules\nenable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal\ninformation associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate\nresponses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following\ndataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a\ncross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset.
