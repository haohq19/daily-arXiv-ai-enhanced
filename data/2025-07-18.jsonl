Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal\nmicrovasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as\npotential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics\nframework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived\nthrough deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to\nhighlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the\nconventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate\nadjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,\nwhich is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal\nphenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum\nlipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography\nElectrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).\nStrong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly\nbetween average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as\ntriacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These\nassociations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under\nmetabolic stress. By linking detailed\n  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a\ncritical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration\nnot only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but\nalso presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,\nnon-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early\ndetection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular\nhealthcare."}

As AI-generated visual content\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of\ndetecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,\nensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been\nsubstantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for\nvideo detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human\nfaces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,\ncreating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos\nwith generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated\nvideos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we\nachieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,\nand we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification\nlayer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we\ncompiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced\nby 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling\nover 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves\nhigh detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.\nUpon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,\nand our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area."}
