This paper compares several LLM-based data enrichment methods and introduces a novel Confidence-Aware Fine-Grained Debate (CFD) framework in which multiple LLM agents simulate human annotators and exchange fine-grained evidence to reach consensus. We describe two new expert-annotated datasets, a mental health Reddit wellbeing dataset and an online safety Facebook sharenting risk dataset. Our CFD framework achieves the most robust data enrichment performance compared to a range of baselines and we show that this type of data enrichment consistently improves downstream tasks. Enriched features incorporated via debate transcripts yield the largest gains, outperforming the non-enriched baseline by 10.1% for the online safety task."}

They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime."}

Microscopic imaging provides organism level visibility, whereas physicochemical sensors reveal shortterm changes in water chemistry; in practice, operators must interpret these streams separately, making realtime decision-making unreliable. This study introduces AquaFusionNet, a lightweight cross-modal framework that unifies both information sources inside a single edge deployable model. Unlike prior work that treats microscopic detection and water quality prediction as independent tasks, AquaFusionNet learns the statistical dependencies between microbial appearance and concurrent sensor dynamics through a gated crossattention mechanism designed specifically for lowpower hardware. The framework is trained on AquaMicro12K, a new dataset comprising 12,846 annotated 1000 micrographs curated for drinking water contexts, an area where publicly accessible microscopic datasets are scarce. Deployed for six months across seven facilities in East Java, Indonesia, the system processed 1.84 million frames and consistently detected contamination events with 94.8% mAP@0.5 and 96.3% anomaly prediction accuracy, while operating at 4.8 W on a Jetson Nano. Comparative experiments against representative lightweight detectors show that AquaFusionNet provides higher accuracy at comparable or lower power, and field results indicate that cross-modal coupling reduces common failure modes of unimodal detectors, particularly under fouling, turbidity spikes, and inconsistent illumination. All models, data, and hardware designs are released openly to facilitate replication and adaptation in decentralized water safety infrastructures."}

The core issue is not a lack of knowledge, but a path selection bias within the vast reasoning search space. Although LVLMs are often capable of sampling correct solution trajectories, they disproportionately favor unstable or logically inconsistent ones, leading to erratic and unreliable outcomes. The substantial disparity between Pass@K (with large K) and Pass@1 across numerous models provides compelling evidence that such failures primarily stem from misreasoning rather than ignorance. To systematically investigate and address this issue, we propose PSO (Path-Select Optimization), a two-stage post-training framework designed to enhance both the reasoning performance and stability of existing LVLMs. In the first stage, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with template and answer-based rewards to cultivate structured, step-by-step reasoning. In the second stage, we conduct online preference optimization, where the model samples reasoning paths from GRPO-generated data, self-evaluates them, and aligns itself toward the preferred trajectories. Incorrect or suboptimal paths are concurrently stored in a Negative Replay Memory (NRM) as hard negatives, which are periodically revisited to prevent the model from repeating prior mistakes and to facilitate continual reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments show that PSO effectively prunes invalid reasoning paths, substantially enhances reasoning accuracy (with 7.4% improvements on average), and yields more stable and consistent chains of thought.

To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel method that improves reconstruction by enforcing global geometry consistency through constrained multi-view triangulation. Our approach aims to achieve a consensus on 3D representation in the physical world by utilizing various estimated views. We optimize this process by penalizing the deviation of a rendered 3D point from a robust consensus point, which is re-triangulated from a bundle of neighboring views in a self-supervised fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

We present an automated method to select a minimal yet comprehensive PRO-CTCAE subset based on historical safety data. Each candidate PRO-CTCAE symptom term is first mapped to its corresponding MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs), which are then encoded into Safeterm, a high-dimensional semantic space capturing clinical and contextual diversity in MedDRA terminology. We score each candidate PRO item for relevance to the historical list of adverse event PTs and combine relevance and incidence into a utility function. Spectral analysis is then applied to the combined utility and diversity matrix to identify an orthogonal set of medical concepts that balances relevance and diversity. Symptoms are rank-ordered by importance, and a cut-off is suggested based on the explained information. The tool is implemented as part of the Safeterm trial-safety app. We evaluate its performance using simulations and oncology case studies in which PRO-CTCAE was employed. This automated approach can streamline PRO-CTCAE design by leveraging MedDRA semantics and historical data, providing an objective and reproducible method to balance signal coverage against patient burden."}

One background model is established in depth signals for measuring magnitude of movements. Because depth signals cannot observe lighting changes, another background model is established in color images for measuring magnitude of lighting effects.

Yet, the impact of initialisation parameters still lacks a precise theoretical understanding for several well-established architectures. Here, we propose a new initialisation for networks with sinusoidal activation functions such as \\texttt{SIREN}, focusing on gradients control, their scaling with network depth, their impact on training and on generalization. To achieve this, we identify a closed-form expression for the initialisation of the parameters, differing from the original \\texttt{SIREN} scheme. This expression is derived from fixed points obtained through the convergence of pre-activation distribution and the variance of Jacobian sequences. Controlling both gradients and targeting vanishing pre-activation helps preventing the emergence of inappropriate frequencies during estimation, thereby improving generalization. We further show that this initialisation strongly influences training dynamics through the Neural Tangent Kernel framework (NTK). Finally, we benchmark \\texttt{SIREN} with the proposed initialisation against the original scheme and other baselines on function fitting and image reconstruction. The new initialisation consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including those involving physics-informed neural networks."}

The method encodes joint angles via population place coding and converts skin-measured forces into spike-rate features using an Izhikevich neuron model; both signals are transformed into bipolar binary vectors and bound element-wise to create associations stored in a large-capacity sequential memory. To improve separability in binary space and inject geometry from touch, we introduce 3D rotary positional embeddings that rotate subspaces as a function of sensed force direction, enabling fuzzy retrieval through a softmax weighted recall over temporally shifted action patterns. On a Toyota Human Support Robot covered by robot skin, the hetero-associative sequential memory system realizes a pseudocompliance controller that moves the link under touch in the direction and with speed correlating to the amplitude of applied force, and it retrieves multi-joint grasp sequences by continuing tactile input. The system sets up quickly, trains from synchronized streams of states and observations, and exhibits a degree of generalization while remaining economical.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks.

To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ), designed to push the limits of quantization, has demonstrated remarkable success in advancing U-Net quantization to sub-4bit settings while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Nevertheless, its application to DiT architectures remains limited and underexplored. In this work, we propose TreeQ, a unified framework addressing key challenges in DiT quantization. First, to tackle inefficient search and proxy misalignment, we introduce Tree Structured Search (TSS). This DiT-specific approach leverages the architecture's linear properties to traverse the solution space in O(n) time while improving objective accuracy through comparison-based pruning. Second, to unify optimization objectives, we propose Environmental Noise Guidance (ENG), which aligns Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) configurations using a single hyperparameter. Third, to mitigate information bottlenecks in ultra-low-bit regimes, we design the General Monarch Branch (GMB).

However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the \"Memory Trap\". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts."}

To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces low-value samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to PPO, GRPO, CISPO, and SFT-only baselines.

The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity, and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against tier-1 SMQs (110 queries, v28.1). Precision, recall and F1 were computed at multiple similarity-thresholds, defined either manually or using an automated method. High recall (94%)) is achieved at moderate similarity thresholds, indicative of good retrieval sensitivity. Higher thresholds filter out more terms, resulting in improved precision (up to 89%). The optimal threshold (0.70)) yielded an overall recall of (48%) and precision of (45%) across all 110 queries. Restricting to narrow-term PTs achieved slightly better performance at an increased (+0.05) similarity threshold, confirming increased relatedness of narrow versus broad terms. The automatic threshold (0.66) selection prioritizes recall (0.58) to precision (0.29). SafeTerm AMQ achieves comparable, satisfactory performance on SMQs and sanitized OCMQs.

In this work, we aim to exploit the spatiotemporal properties of event streams based on point cloud-based framework, designed to enhance human pose estimation performance. We design Event Temporal Slicing Convolution module to capture short-term dependencies across event slices, and combine it with Event Slice Sequencing module for structured temporal modeling. We also apply edge enhancement in point cloud-based event representation to enhance spatial edge information under sparse event conditions to further improve performance. Experiments on the DHP19 dataset show our proposed method consistently improves performance across three representative point cloud backbones: PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer."}

Lake Champlain is particularly vulnerable to recurring CyanoHAB events, especially in its northern segment: Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay, and Northeast Arm, due to nutrient enrichment and climatic variability. Remote sensing provides a scalable solution for monitoring and forecasting these events, offering continuous coverage where in situ observations are sparse or unavailable. In this study, we present a remote sensing only forecasting framework that combines Transformers and BiLSTM to predict CyanoHAB intensities up to 14 days in advance. The system utilizes Cyanobacterial Index data from the Cyanobacterial Assessment Network and temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites to capture long range dependencies and sequential dynamics in satellite time series. The dataset is very sparse, missing more than 30% of the Cyanobacterial Index data and 90% of the temperature data. A two stage preprocessing pipeline addressed data gaps by applying forward fill and weighted temporal imputation at the pixel level, followed by smoothing to reduce the discontinuities of CyanoHAB events. The raw dataset is transformed into meaningful features through equal frequency binning for the Cyanobacterial Index values and extracted temperature statistics. Transformer BiLSTM model demonstrates strong forecasting performance across multiple horizons, achieving F1 scores of 89.5%, 86.4%, and 85.5% at one, two, and three-day forecasts, respectively, and maintaining an F1 score of 78.9% with an AUC of 82.6% at the 14-day horizon. These results confirm the model's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse satellite data and to provide reliable early warning for CyanoHABs management."}

A probing study finds that LLMs' internal representations can reliably identify incoherent narratives.

The reasoning LLMs tested do not eliminate these deficits, indicating that thought strings may not be able to fully address the discrepancy between model internal state and behavior. Additionally, we find that LLMs appear to be more sensitive to incoherence resulting from an event that violates the setting (e.g., a rainy day in the desert) than to incoherence arising from a character violating an established trait (e.g., Mary, a vegetarian, later orders a cheeseburger), suggesting that LLMs may rely more on prototypical world knowledge than building meaning-based narrative coherence.

To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA.

In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the \"incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets."}

We formalize this distinction as the gap between deep feature-space and shallow classifier-level forgetting. We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the \"strong collapse\" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay."}

Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel MSA framework designed for domain generalization. Firstly, the framework incorporates a Mixture of Invariant Experts model to extract domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to learn synergistic relationships between modalities. Secondly, we design a Cross-Modal Adapter to augment the semantic richness of multimodal representations through cross-modal knowledge injection.

These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection."}

We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains.

Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing."}

We formalize this distinction as the gap between deep feature-space and shallow classifier-level forgetting. We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the \"strong collapse\" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay."}

Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets.

We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data.

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing."}

However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the \"Memory Trap\". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts."}

While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by \"vanishing token information\", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth. To validate this hypothesis, we quantify a token's information content by measuring the change in the model output probabilities upon its removal. Using this proposed metric, our analysis of the information of visual tokens across layers reveals three key findings: (1) As layers deepen, the information of visual tokens gradually becomes uniform and eventually vanishes at an intermediate layer, which we term as \"information horizon\", beyond which the visual tokens become redundant; (2) The position of this horizon is not static; it extends deeper for visually intensive tasks, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), compared to more general tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA); (3) This horizon is also strongly correlated with model capacity, as stronger VLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) employ deeper visual tokens than weaker models (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Based on our findings, we show that simple random pruning in deep layers efficiently balances performance and efficiency. Moreover, integrating random pruning consistently enhances existing methods. Using DivPrune with random pruning achieves state-of-the-art results, maintaining 96.9% of Qwen-2.5-VL-7B performance while pruning 50% of visual tokens.

Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model.

Further experiments validate that our approach resolves the dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality for truncated diffusion models, achieving the best trade-off.

Microscopic imaging provides organism level visibility, whereas physicochemical sensors reveal shortterm changes in water chemistry; in practice, operators must interpret these streams separately, making realtime decision-making unreliable. This study introduces AquaFusionNet, a lightweight cross-modal framework that unifies both information sources inside a single edge deployable model. Unlike prior work that treats microscopic detection and water quality prediction as independent tasks, AquaFusionNet learns the statistical dependencies between microbial appearance and concurrent sensor dynamics through a gated crossattention mechanism designed specifically for lowpower hardware. The framework is trained on AquaMicro12K, a new dataset comprising 12,846 annotated 1000 micrographs curated for drinking water contexts, an area where publicly accessible microscopic datasets are scarce. Deployed for six months across seven facilities in East Java, Indonesia, the system processed 1.84 million frames and consistently detected contamination events with 94.8% mAP@0.5 and 96.3% anomaly prediction accuracy, while operating at 4.8 W on a Jetson Nano. Comparative experiments against representative lightweight detectors show that AquaFusionNet provides higher accuracy at comparable or lower power, and field results indicate that cross-modal coupling reduces common failure modes of unimodal detectors, particularly under fouling, turbidity spikes, and inconsistent illumination. All models, data, and hardware designs are released openly to facilitate replication and adaptation in decentralized water safety infrastructures."}
