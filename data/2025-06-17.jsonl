We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking\nkey events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires\nreasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small\nmodels like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as\nClaude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another\nLLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection\nand classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits:\nfor instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal\ndynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When\nanalyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual\nframing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors\nstep-by-step causal reasoning.

Specifically, we prove that any\ntransformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only\n$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \\ll N$, and that this cannot be\nimproved in the worst case.

This practice is the default in most implementations and is\nwidely seen as desirable for causal inference. But we show that honesty can\nhurt the accuracy of individual-level effect estimates. The reason is a classic\nbias-variance trade-off: honesty reduces variance by preventing overfitting,\nbut increases bias by limiting the model's ability to discover and exploit\nmeaningful heterogeneity in treatment effects. This trade-off depends on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR): honesty helps when effect heterogeneity is hard to\ndetect (low SNR), but hurts when the signal is strong (high SNR).

We find\nthat reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers,\ndemonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these\nbehaviors but is unreliable.\n  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned\nintentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We\nrelease three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent\nmisalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation\nsuite."}

While these\nmulti-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model\nperformance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the\nfirst systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the\ncontext of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the\ninfluence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained\nmodel without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms,\noriginally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In\nparticular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive\ninformation often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT\ntrajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and\npropose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a\nnovel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and\nprevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the\nmodel's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$\nsignificantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and\nachieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks,\nevaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B."}
