The dataset includes 14 clinically\nsignificant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along\nwith contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital\noccurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and\noverlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We\nevaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:\nfine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While\ntransformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on\ndocument-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops\nnotably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly\nfor rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite\nhigh-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented\nAEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted\nResearch Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch\nand serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and\nsupporting future cross-dataset generalisation."}

While DETR-like architectures offer a\npowerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent\nlimitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these\nchallenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally\nadvance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.\nFirst, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the\nintegration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves\nthe stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization\nobjective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to\naddress the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which\nseverely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly\nintroduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and\nunlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated\nself-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to\nsynergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the\niterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that\nMonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular\nbenchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components\nseamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant\nperformance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes\ndataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities."}

A channel-wise masked\nreconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase\nstate vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus\nenhancing model generalization.

In\nreal-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the\ndisjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are\ntypically generated by an \\emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients.

Specifically, we propose a\nflexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that\ncan produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the\nbitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while\npreventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original\nimage compression functionality.

A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed\nto produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the\ndecoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an\nUncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed\nto leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on\nthe training data.
