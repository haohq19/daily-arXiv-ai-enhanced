This multilingual resource features consistent and comprehensive metadata, and multiple types of annotation with rigorous human evaluations for downstream tasks relevant to systematic transnational analyses of contentious wartime discourse. DNIPRO's distinctive value lies in its inclusion of competing geopolitical perspectives, making it uniquely suited for studying narrative divergence, media framing, and information warfare. To demonstrate its utility, we include use case experiments using stance detection, sentiment analysis, topical framing, and contradiction analysis of major conflict events within the larger war. Our explorations reveal how outlets construct competing realities, with coverage exhibiting polarized interpretations that reflect geopolitical interests. Beyond supporting computational journalism research, DNIPRO provides a foundational resource for understanding how conflicting narratives emerge and evolve across global information ecosystems."}

We propose truth-coupling, i.e. how tightly venue scores track latent scientific truth, as the right objective for review tools. We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation."}

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks."}

However, this process can sometimes result in the loss or distortion of the original intended meaning. Due to the human-like quality of LLM-generated text, traditional detection methods often fail, particularly when text is paraphrased to closely mimic original content. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach named SearchLLM, designed to identify LLM-paraphrased text by leveraging search engine capabilities to locate potential original text sources. By analyzing similarities between the input and regenerated versions of candidate sources, SearchLLM effectively distinguishes LLM-paraphrased content. SearchLLM is designed as a proxy layer, allowing seamless integration with existing detectors to enhance their performance. Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate that SearchLLM consistently enhances the accuracy of recent detectors in detecting LLM-paraphrased text that closely mimics original content. Furthermore, SearchLLM also helps the detectors prevent paraphrasing attacks."}

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs."}

Current Transformer-based regression models trained primarily on native-speaker corpora often learn spurious correlations between surface-level L2 linguistic features and essay quality. In this study, we conduct a bias study of a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model using the ASAP 2.0 and ELLIPSE datasets, revealing a constrained score scaling for high-proficiency ESL writing where high-proficiency ESL essays receive scores 10.3% lower than Native speaker essays of identical human-rated quality. To mitigate this, we propose applying contrastive learning with a triplet construction strategy: Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs. We constructed a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs and fine-tuned the model using Triplet Margin Loss to align the latent representations of ESL and Native writing. Our approach reduced the high-proficiency scoring disparity by 39.9% (to a 6.2% gap) while maintaining a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.76. Post-hoc linguistic analysis suggests the model successfully disentangled sentence complexity from grammatical error, preventing the penalization of valid L2 syntactic structures."}
