This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a\nhigh-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7\npassive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight\n1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control\nmethod to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior\nperformance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip\nrepeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared\nto PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,\nsignificantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload\nduring collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps,\nsuccessfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation\ntasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous\nhands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation\nand intelligent manufacturing."}

This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework\nfor (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device\nanomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning\nmodels are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning\n(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised\nlearning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The\ncomprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,\nprecision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost\nachieved 99\\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly\ndetection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.\nLSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For\nattack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score\nwith the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.\nGAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.\nThese findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective\nanomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and\ndevice failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,\nminimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of\nmedical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven\nhealthcare solutions."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event\ncamera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains\nmore than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,\nincluding seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.\nEvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,\nproviding an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth\nlearning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised\nlearning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We\nfurther demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability\nto generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for\nframe-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data."}
