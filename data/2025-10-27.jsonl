This study focuses on assessing the\nstructural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed\nsteel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.\nSteel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or\nshear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an\nindication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect\nexposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey\nEarthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete\nstructures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced\nwith fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An\nautomated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify\ninside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only\nLook Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed\nbars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of\nstructural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid\nframework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input\nimages. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection\nfollowing disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing\nimage data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches."}

Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is\ncritical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding\nspurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such\ndependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a\nself-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about\nvisual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the\nagent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a\nself-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain\nmodel behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its\nfindings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach\non a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute\ndependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's\nperformance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant\nperformance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that\nthe agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in\nstate-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object\ndetector."}

Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address\nthis, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to\nrevise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions\nsuch as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment\nof LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or\noverbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce\nautomatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan\nmaintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and\nappropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,\nand sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply\nan LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we\nperform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,\nspatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs\nmaintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial\ndeviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,\nindicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,\ndisruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting\nlimits in LLM robustness.

In this\nwork, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key\negocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and\ncurrent activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on\nvisual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze\nonly during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that\naligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,\nallowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize\nattention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic\nprediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for\ncurrent activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models\ntrained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of\ngaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric\nVLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to\nenhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like\nassistive robots and human-machine collaboration.
