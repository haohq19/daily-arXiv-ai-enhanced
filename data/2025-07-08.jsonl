Their high agility and unpredictable\nmotion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods\nfocus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on\nforecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection\nto be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised\nvision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of\ndrones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone\ntrajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with\ncamera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We\nthen combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a\nself-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our\nmethod on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that\nfeature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban\nscenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised\nimage-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction,\nreducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D\nlabels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for\nreal-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance\nto support reproducible research in the robotics community."}

While recent work has explored the use of large language\nmodels (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the\nunconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to\nmitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive\nConfounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world\nknowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden\nconfounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong\nsemantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible\nconfounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded\nworld knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent\nconfounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning\nstrategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders\nand significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets\nand LLMs."}

However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision.

An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of\nplasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts\noptimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it\nresults in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In\nthis paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that\nprevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the\nplasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the\nlearning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and\nbalances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR\nimproves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and\nsingle-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks."}

We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require\ncomplex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating\nthe experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad\nbehavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose\nits reasoning, making it monitorable.

Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically\nbrief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural\nlanguage are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the\nexpensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task\nof explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the\nunderlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and\ntime. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available\ndatasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the\nproblem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of\ndescriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while\nstate-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating\nshorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos\nand text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and\nlanguage is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared\nrepresentation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space\nand time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to\nintegrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural\nlanguage description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and\nexplainable video description generation process can function as a fully\nautomatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student\npathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that\nour explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant\ntextual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using\nboth standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from\nensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs."}
