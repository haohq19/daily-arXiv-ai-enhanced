Philip Chen", "Tong Zhang"], "title": "AIM: Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning", "comment": "13pages,7 figures", "summary": "Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance\nbut still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal\nlearning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is\ntypically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we\nfind that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to\npromote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We\nanalyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem:\noptimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nIntra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM\naccounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths\nwithin the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning\nwithout hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time.\nSpecifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters\ninto Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded\nblocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively\nprevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization\nof under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally,\nAIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively\nadjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods\nacross multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across\ndifferent backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers."}

While neuromorphic computing provides an energy-efficient\nalternative, spiking neural networks struggle to match of performance of\nstate-of-the-art models in complex event-based vision tasks, like object\ndetection and optical flow.

Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a\njoint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images.

In practice, factors such as\nurban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather\nfrequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where\nonly partial correspondences exist between pairs.
