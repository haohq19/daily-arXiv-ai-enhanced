*Inamullah,Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组学数据的创新框架，用于早期心血管疾病（CVD）风险的无症状生物标志物识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心血管疾病风险分层方法难以检测早期亚临床变化，且缺乏视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组学数据的整合研究。

Method: 采用深度学习图像处理技术量化视网膜微血管特征，结合超高效液相色谱电喷雾高分辨质谱（UHPLC ESI HRMS）分析血清脂质组学数据，进行大规模协变量调整和分层相关分析。

Result: 发现视网膜微血管特征（如平均动脉宽度、血管密度）与特定脂质亚类（如TAGs、DAGs、Cers）之间存在显著相关性，提示代谢压力下的微血管重塑机制。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了早期CVD发病机制理解的空白，为无创生物标志物识别提供了新视角，有望改善早期检测和个性化预防策略。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

*Yanchen Guan,Haicheng Liao,Chengyue Wang,Bonan Wang,Jiaxun Zhang,Jia Hu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双分支架构的交通事故预测框架，结合视觉和文本数据，利用大模型和提示工程提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发精确且计算高效的交通事故预测系统，以支持自动驾驶技术的及时干预和损失预防。

Method: 采用双分支架构整合视觉和文本数据，结合大模型（GPT-4o、Long-CLIP）和提示工程进行特征聚合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了方法的预测准确性、响应速度、计算效率和可解释性，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: 该框架为交通事故预测设定了新的性能基准，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing precise and computationally efficient traffic accident
anticipation system is crucial for contemporary autonomous driving
technologies, enabling timely intervention and loss prevention. In this paper,
we propose an accident anticipation framework employing a dual-branch
architecture that effectively integrates visual information from dashcam videos
with structured textual data derived from accident reports. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature aggregation method that facilitates seamless integration of
multimodal inputs through large models (GPT-4o, Long-CLIP), complemented by
targeted prompt engineering strategies to produce actionable feedback and
standardized accident archives. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on
benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, and A3D) validate the superior predictive
accuracy, enhanced responsiveness, reduced computational overhead, and improved
interpretability of our approach, thus establishing a new benchmark for
state-of-the-art performance in traffic accident anticipation.

### [3] [FIQ: Fundamental Question Generation with the Integration of Question Embeddings for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12816)
*Ju-Young Oh,Ho-Joong Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FIQ的新方法，通过生成基于视频描述的问题-答案对，增强视频问答模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法主要依赖事件中心的问题-答案对，缺乏对视频中对象类型、空间布局等基础信息的捕捉，限制了模型的泛化和推理能力。

Method: FIQ方法通过生成基于视频描述的问题-答案对，丰富训练数据，并结合VQ-CAlign模块对齐视觉特征与问题嵌入。

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA数据集上，FIQ达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FIQ通过增强对视频基础信息的理解，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和推理能力。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

### [4] [SE-VLN: A Self-Evolving Vision-Language Navigation Framework Based on Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13152)
*Xiangyu Dong,Haoran Zhao,Jiang Gao,Haozhou Li,Xiaoguang Ma,Yaoming Zhou,Fuhai Chen,Juan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自进化的视觉语言导航框架（SE-VLN），通过分层记忆、检索增强推理和反思模块，实现了在测试中持续进化的能力，显著提升了导航成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的视觉语言导航方法受限于固定的知识库和推理能力，无法有效整合经验知识，缺乏进化能力。

Method: SE-VLN包含三个核心模块：分层记忆模块（存储成功和失败案例）、检索增强推理模块（多步决策）和反思模块（持续进化）。

Result: 在R2R和REVERSE数据集上，导航成功率分别达到57%和35.2%，比现有方法提升了23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN展示了作为自进化框架的巨大潜力，性能随经验库增长而提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

### [5] [AthleticsPose: Authentic Sports Motion Dataset on Athletic Field and Evaluation of Monocular 3D Pose Estimation Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12905)
*Tomohiro Suzuki,Ryota Tanaka,Calvin Yeung,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AthleticsPose数据集，用于单目3D姿态估计在体育分析中的应用，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体育分析中缺乏真实运动数据集和姿态估计可靠性不明确的问题。

Method: 使用AthleticsPose数据集训练3D姿态估计模型，并与基线模型对比。

Result: 模型在真实运动数据上表现显著优于基线，MPJPE降低约75%，但受相机视角和主体尺度影响。

Conclusion: 真实运动数据对模型性能至关重要，但模型在高速运动指标上存在局限性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

### [6] [FantasyPortrait: Enhancing Multi-Character Portrait Animation with Expression-Augmented Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12956)
*Qiang Wang,Mengchao Wang,Fan Jiang,Yaqi Fan,Yonggang Qi,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait提出了一种基于扩散变换器的框架，用于从静态图像生成高质量、情感丰富的面部动画，支持单人和多角色场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式几何先验，容易产生伪影且难以捕捉细微情感，同时缺乏多角色动画支持。

Method: 采用扩散变换器框架，引入表达增强学习策略和掩码交叉注意力机制，以隐式表示捕捉面部动态并防止特征干扰。

Result: 实验表明，FantasyPortrait在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有方法，尤其在跨重演和多角色场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait通过创新方法解决了现有挑战，并提出了专用数据集和基准，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

### [7] [Leveraging Pre-Trained Visual Models for AI-Generated Video Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13224)
*Keerthi Veeramachaneni,Praveen Tirupattur,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用预训练视觉模型检测AI生成视频的新方法，无需额外训练即可实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频质量的提升，检测这类内容以防止虚假信息和隐私泄露变得至关重要。

Method: 利用预训练视觉模型提取特征，并通过线性分类层区分真实与生成视频。

Result: 在包含10,000个AI生成视频和4,000个真实视频的数据集上，平均检测准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外训练，计划公开代码、模型和数据集以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

### [8] [VideoITG: Multimodal Video Understanding with Instructed Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13353)
*Shihao Wang,Guo Chen,De-an Huang,Zhiqi Li,Minghan Li,Guilin Li,Jose M. Alvarez,Lei Zhang,Zhiding Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VideoITG方法，通过用户指令定制化帧采样，结合VidThinker管道和VideoITG-40K数据集，显著提升视频大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中难以处理复杂场景，需改进帧选择的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出VidThinker管道，分三步：生成指令相关的剪辑级描述、检索相关视频片段、精细选择关键帧。

Result: 构建VideoITG-40K数据集，VideoITG模型在多模态视频理解基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: VideoITG通过指令驱动的帧选择，显著提升视频理解能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

### [9] [Probabilistic Soundness Guarantees in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12948)
*Weiqiu You,Anton Xue,Shreya Havaldar,Delip Rao,Helen Jin,Chris Callison-Burch,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARES是一种新的概率框架，通过仅基于已验证的前提判断每个主张，有效检测并防止LLM推理链中的错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的错误检测方法未能有效处理初始错误在推理链中的传播问题，导致最终结论不可靠。

Method: 提出Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES)框架，采用归纳方法为每个推理步骤生成细粒度评分，并提供统计保证。

Result: ARES在四个基准测试中表现最佳（72.1% Macro-F1，提升8.2点），并在长推理链中表现出更强的鲁棒性（90.3% F1，提升27.6点）。

Conclusion: ARES通过防止错误传播，显著提升了LLM推理链的可靠性。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

### [10] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将概率事件演算（PEC）转化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），以支持目标导向推理，同时保持PEC的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC在不确定环境中具有优势，但缺乏目标导向推理机制，需扩展其能力。

Method: 通过引入“动作执行情境”将PEC领域形式化转化为MDP，保留PEC的灵活语义。

Result: PEC-MDP形式化支持时间推理和目标驱动规划，并能将学习策略映射回可读的PEC表示。

Conclusion: PEC-MDP结合了PEC的可解释性与MDP的算法工具，扩展了PEC的应用范围。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

### [11] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态强化学习框架，改进静态树结构推理方法，提升问题解答的适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型在复杂问题解答中面临错误传播和知识整合的挑战，现有树结构推理方法（如ProbTree）因静态实现和计算效率不足而受限。

Method: 采用动态强化学习框架，实时构建推理树并学习最优策略，选择性扩展和资源分配。

Result: 在保持概率严谨性的同时，提升了解答质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为树结构推理提供了新范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和现实问题解答的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型内部存在能够区分模态类别（可能、不可能、无意义等）的线性表示（模态差异向量），这些向量能够预测人类的模态分类行为，为理解语言模型和人类的模态分类提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究质疑语言模型按模态分类句子的能力，但语言模型需要能够辨别句子的模态类别（可能、不可能、完全无意义等）才能可靠地完成各种任务。因此需要重新评估语言模型的模态分类能力。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术，在多种语言模型中识别能够区分模态类别的线性表示（模态差异向量），分析这些向量在不同训练步骤、层数和参数规模下的出现模式，并将向量投影与人类参与者对可解释特征的评分进行关联分析。

Result: 发现语言模型具有比之前报告更可靠的模态分类判断能力；模态差异向量随着模型能力提升（训练步骤、层数、参数数量）以一致的顺序出现；模态差异向量能够模拟人类细粒度的分类行为。

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性技术获得了语言模型模态分类的新见解，模态差异向量不仅揭示了语言模型内部的模态表示机制，还有潜力帮助理解人类的模态分类过程。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

### [13] [Comparing Apples to Oranges: A Dataset & Analysis of LLM Humour Understanding from Traditional Puns to Topical Jokes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13335)
*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）解释不同类型幽默的能力，发现现有模型无法可靠解释复杂幽默形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算幽默研究主要关注简单双关笑话，忽略了复杂幽默形式。

Method: 构建包含4种笑话类型的数据集，比较多种LLMs的零样本解释能力。

Result: 测试模型（包括推理模型）均无法可靠解释所有笑话类型。

Conclusion: 现有计算幽默研究对复杂幽默形式的关注不足。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.
