We\npropose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual\ntime-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron\ntracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned\ngate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to\npreserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,\naddressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a\nvariance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by\nbiological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved\naccuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal\nclassification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared\nto about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower\nfor prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or\nexpensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully\ncompatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of\nIntel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for\non-chip learning.

However, in real-world\nsettings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events\nunfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the\nactual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)\npresents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating\nmultimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain\ncautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most\nexisting LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and\nignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time\nseries with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and\nexplainability.

This\nlimitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To\naddress this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline\nand (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a\ndataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based\npipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we\npropose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the\narchitectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the\nstructural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes\ninto coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input\nlevel, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For\ninstance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens \"not\" and\n\"girl\" as simply \"girl\", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning\nis correctly distinguished from that of \"girl\" alone. This module is integrated\nwith a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method\nsignificantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a\nlowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval\nand demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step\nforward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection\napplications."}
