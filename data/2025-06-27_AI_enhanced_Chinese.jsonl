A modified\nKalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range\nmeasurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.\nAn event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust\ntarget state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor\nmeasurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the\nestimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,\nleveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct\nextensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the\nproposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments.

We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations.

Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to\ndomain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with\nlarge inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of\ndiffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting\nintermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature\ncollection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing\nperformance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an\nobject-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class\nprompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.\nWe also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,\nbalancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving\nperformance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a\nunified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through\nfeature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and\nunlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection\nperformance (i.e., Transferability).

To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized.

We empirically\nevaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D\nobstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms\nstandard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative\nreward and over 30% fewer conflict events.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards.

A common\napproach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;\nhowever, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.\nMoreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy\nadversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN\nperturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as\nbenign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These\nadversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success\nrates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based\nregret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based\ndetectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

These models operate in a bitwise\nautoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically\ninfinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a\ngrowing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are\nlikely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same\nmodels. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at\nthe bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as\nresolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark.

Object detectors and\nsegmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the\nmodel's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification.

In this\nwork, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.\nBounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used\nto describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as\nbounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of\nbounding boxes and classes.

Traditional\nmethods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,\nbut struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across\nmodalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple\nembeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more\ndiverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,\nthese set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse\nsupervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize\none-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity\nwithin the set.
