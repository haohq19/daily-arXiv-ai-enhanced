However,\nexisting diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and\ncostly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we\ndistill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.\nUnfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades\nvideo quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these\nissues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose\nconditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using\naccurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention\nto relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This\ninput-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens\ntemporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and\nmotion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an\ninput-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion\nrealism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,\nour method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared\nto recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive\nexperiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices."}

Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging\ndue to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural\nnetworks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists\nin retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to\nmitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the\ncontinually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)\nreliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance\ndegradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.\nIn this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more\nexpressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank\nadaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose\nreparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected\nfunctions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic\nconditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic\nforgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.\nExtensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,\nshowcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method\nsurpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching\nhigher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the\nmemory cost and sampling time."}

Moreover, rather than seeking to\nprovide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the\npossibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites\nthat enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and\nthe possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities\nthat the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of\npossibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there\nare multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to\ndetermine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to\ncomplete.

Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely\non uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to\nincorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches\nimpose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window\nsuppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at\nlimiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near\nimportant events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect\nquery relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module\nfor query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified\nRelevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a\nquery-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to\nyield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak\nalignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating\nmechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method\nseamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without\nadditional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally\nefficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing\nVLMs in a plug-and-play manner.
