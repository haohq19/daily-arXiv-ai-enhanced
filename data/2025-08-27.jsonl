However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents."}

This work introduces a novel\ncontext-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal\nevents without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed\nhybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal\ndynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to\nextract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future\nrepresentations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based\nsemantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through\ncontext-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using\nInfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic\nrepresentations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by\nmodulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By\nintegrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system\ncan generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This\nframework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in\nzero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance.

The field faces challenges because electromagnetic\nsignals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong\nbackground noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents\nexisting general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and\nsensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and\ntransfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the\ncreation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these\nissue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that\nbridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We\nbuild the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset\ncovering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties\nof electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing\nmethod and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and\nrepresentation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments\nshow that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across\nmany downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified\nframework for electromagnetic intelligence.

However, both often\nlimit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated\nExploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to\ncombat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its\nlogarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a\nPlackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights\nproportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add\nentropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature\ncollapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous\n(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,\naligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior\nbetter or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO\nprovides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging\nfull-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability."}
