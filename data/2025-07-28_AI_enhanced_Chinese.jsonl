However, their reliance\non expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,\nparticularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS\n(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera\ninput, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the\ncollision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and\nestimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs\nlike YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,\ndetection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features\nextracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,\nthe robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in\nobject detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor\nattack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike\nexisting attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox\nsubtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in\ndataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting\ndownstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized\nin the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with\nonly a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.\nFurthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning\nstrategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in\ndownstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially\nresulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aShrinkBox\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684ADAS\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u6765\u7834\u574f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfADAS\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684ADAS\uff08ML-ADAS\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShrinkBox\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u800c\u975e\u6539\u53d8\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u7269\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9YOLOv9m\u7b49\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cShrinkBox\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523096%\uff0c\u4ec5\u97004%\u7684\u6295\u6bd2\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "ShrinkBox\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9ML-ADAS\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u529f\u80fd\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Anonymized free text\nclinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of\none academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal\nMedicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE\nRC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities\n(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on\ndetecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged\nF1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences\nfor the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best\nperforming model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and\n0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best\nin our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using\npredicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs\nwere detected.

Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation.

Our analysis of two\nmainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype\nlearning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning\nmethods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance\nthe conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS\nframeworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we\npropose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which\nintroduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention\nScore Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning\nmodel (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions\ngenerated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype\npredictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image\nrepresentations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)\nrelationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of\nthe affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually\nincreasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method.

Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/", "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.
