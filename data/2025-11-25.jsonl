However, most existing annotations are event-centric, which restricts the model's ability to capture the comprehensive context of a scene. The lack of fundamental information such as object categories, spatial configurations, and descriptive visual attributes prevents the model from forming a complete understanding of the environment, ultimately limiting its generalization and reasoning capability. In this paper, we introduce Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach (FIQ), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capability of VQA models by improving their foundational comprehension of video content. FIQ generates Q&A pairs from descriptive information extracted directly from videos, thereby enriching the dataset with core scene-level attributes. These generated pairs help the model develop a more holistic understanding of the video, leading to improved generalizability and reasoning performance. In addition, we propose a VQ-CAlign module that aligns task-specific question embeddings with corresponding visual features, preserving essential contextual cues and enhancing adaptability to downstream tasks. Experimental results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset demonstrate that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baseline approaches."}

We introduce a framework to test epistemic stance transfer: targeted deletion of event knowledge, validated with multiple probes, followed by evaluation of whether models still reproduce the community's organic response patterns under ignorance. Using Russian--Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data, we find that even after aggressive fact removal, aligned LLMs maintain stable, community-specific behavioral patterns for handling uncertainty. These results provide evidence that alignment encodes structured, generalizable behaviors beyond surface mimicry. Our framework offers a systematic way to detect behavioral biases that persist under ignorance, advancing efforts toward safer and more transparent LLM deployments."}

Although continual learning approaches have been studied for various applications, targeted research on continual learning approaches specifically designed for medical vision-language tasks remains underexplored. We propose MedPEFT-CL, a parameter-efficient continual learning framework that addresses both efficient learning of new tasks and preservation of previous knowledge through a dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg. Our dual-phase architecture features an adaptive learning phase that employs semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical tasks through prompt similarity analysis, and a knowledge consolidation phase employing bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. This creates a reinforcing cycle: consolidation directs replay priorities while new tasks provide challenging samples that improve retention strategies. Our key contributions are: (1) a semantic-driven adapter allocation mechanism that enables efficient learning of new medical tasks, (2) a bi-modal LoRA adaptation that significantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining cross-modal learning, and (3) bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination that prevents catastrophic forgetting from previous medical tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate superior forgetting mitigation and performance retention with minimal parameter overhead, making the framework effective for continual learning in medical vision-language scenarios."}

We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information.

However, applying Dreamer to aerial systems has been quite challenging due to its sample inefficiency and poor generalization of dynamics models. Our work explores a physics-informed approach to world model learning and improves policy performance. The world model treats the quadcopter as a free-body system and predicts the net forces and moments acting on it, which are then passed through a 6-DOF Runge-Kutta integrator (RK4) to predict future state rollouts. In this paper, we compare this physics-informed method to a standard RNN-based world model.

Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks.

This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection."}

However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs.

We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth.

While they perform well when fine-tuned for a single embodiment or task family, extending them to multi-skill settings remains challenging: directly merging VLA experts trained on different tasks results in near-zero success rates. This raises a fundamental question: what prevents VLAs from mastering multiple skills within one model? With an empirical decomposition of learnable parameters during VLA fine-tuning, we identify two key sources of non-mergeability: (1) Finetuning drives LoRA adapters in the VLM backbone toward divergent, task-specific directions beyond the capacity of existing merging methods to unify. (2) Action experts develop inter-block dependencies through self-attention feedback, causing task information to spread across layers and preventing modular recombination. To address these challenges, we present MergeVLA, a merging-oriented VLA architecture that preserves mergeability by design. MergeVLA introduces sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks to retain consistent parameters and reduce irreconcilable conflicts in the VLM. Its action expert replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks to keep specialization localized and composable. When the task is unknown, it uses a test-time task router to adaptively select the appropriate task mask and expert head from the initial observation, enabling unsupervised task inference. Across LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and multi-task experiments on the real SO101 robotic arm, MergeVLA achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding individually finetuned experts, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks, embodiments, and environments."}

In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples.

The Safeterm map is available online and connected to aggregated AE incidence tables from ClinicalTrials.gov.

In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models."}

This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing."}

However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of conventional appearance modelling in multi-object tracking, we introduce an event-enhanced association mechanism that leverages motion cues from the event modality for more reliable identity maintenance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category.

This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning. If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning. Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises. PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO. Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse."}

Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks."}

In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training."}

Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical \"domain shift\" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment."}

VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct \"key-information-missing\" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks.

In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios.

We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information.

This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection."}
