The study is based on the\nanalysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional\nstates of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem\nof class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.\nTo solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with\nan attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative\nfor emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is\ntrained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with\nsubsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training\nstage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although\nthe degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are\nworse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an\nincrease in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates\nthe promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the\nsearch for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed\nmethod can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in\ntasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution."}

However, its application in conversational AI is\nfundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic\ncomputational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$.\nCurrent models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation\nhistory with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long\ndialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters\nthe scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation\nfrom quadratic ($O(N^2 \\cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \\cdot T)$) with respect to\nthe number of interactions $N$.

The entanglement\ncreates competing goals for the model, suggesting that more explicit separation\nof these two aspects could lead to improved performance. To this front, we\nintroduce Deco-G, a decoding framework that explicitly decouples format\nadherence from task solving.

Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes\ncontexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory),\nconsistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on\nfinance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost.\nNotably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by\nleveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches\nthe top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it\non the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model.\nThese results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable,\nefficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead."}

Existing systems are assessed\nusing different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible\ncomparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains\nunder-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We\naddress these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the\nfundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy\nprovides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the\nfirst quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons\nacross environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark\ndataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned\nbaseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our\nexperiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current\napproaches under perceptual aliasing.

Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt\ntraining-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization,\nbut these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often\ndistort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an\ninput-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach\nleverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without\nparameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by\ncontrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with\nknowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual\ndiscrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an\ninput-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the\nerasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge\nwhile enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and\nQwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting\nperformance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation."}

Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using\na fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach\ncan be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for\ndomains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted\nby the vast, generic dataset.\n  This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss\nfunction with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical\nvalidation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for\neach domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher\nweight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that\neven rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing\nthem from being overshadowed.\n  We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs,\ncomplexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and\nefficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four\ndiverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music)\nwith state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that\nthis dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods,\nparticularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics\nlike Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser\ndomains and introducing minimal computational overhead."}

Improving\noversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that\nimprove learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce\nInoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that\nprevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to\nexplicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we\nmodify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only\nworks on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we\nfind that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially\nreducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which\nmore strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more\neffectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this\nserves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is\na simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning,\npreventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting\ndesired capabilities."}

However, its application in conversational AI is\nfundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic\ncomputational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$.\nCurrent models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation\nhistory with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long\ndialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters\nthe scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation\nfrom quadratic ($O(N^2 \\cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \\cdot T)$) with respect to\nthe number of interactions $N$.
