To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted\nusing a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally\nintroducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,\nconsisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for\nfacial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The\ncrossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but\ndoubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates\nthe importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.\nFacial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most\n(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.\nAmong the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4\nshowed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that\nfacial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived\nrisk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model\nwas implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated\nwell with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective\nperceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and\nhighlighting areas for future research."}

Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is\na challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation\nmodels applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the\nrecognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods\nhave been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,\nconstruct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a\nmethodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic\ntime series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time\nseries data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling\ninterval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training\nusing 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test\ndatasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed\nzero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of\nevaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these\npredictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over\nautocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we\nobserved a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive\nperformance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic\ntime series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this\nscaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it\nsuggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial\ncomputational resources.

Conversely, TTA can perform\nmore stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.\nHowever, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed\nand still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial\nsolutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into\nthis, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often\nundergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that\ncertain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)\nthe model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification\nbias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy\nminimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)\nremove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights\nto go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy\nsamples.
