As vision is often the sole\nmodality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing\nvideo-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,\ncausal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,\nwe introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples\nperception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,\ninterpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,\ntraining-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract\ncritical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which\nare hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined\nwith a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning\nfor the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.\nEvaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's\nproposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and\nglobal context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot\ndriving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By\ngrounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a\nzero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for\npost-hoc driving video understanding."}

In this work, we contribute on both the methodology\nand dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian\nprediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and\nexpressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials\nelectronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the\nzeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial\ncharge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in\nthe input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output\nlevel, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to\nthe target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output\nmapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with\nstrict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian\nprediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy\nperformance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing\nerror amplification and the occurrence of \"ghost states\" caused by the large\ncondition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a\nhigh-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,\ncomprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the\nperiodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results\non Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and\nefficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures."}

Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain\napplications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into\nmodels, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT)\ntreats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to\nprioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with\nquestion-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures\nnecessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nReinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach\niteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model\nthrough calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually\ncoherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log\nprobabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward\nmetrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain\nexpertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations\ngenerated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across\nmedical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.
