Some\nstudies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks\n(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when\noperating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,\nleading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,\nthe NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The\nproposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during\nsquat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited\nattention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic\nmodel with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than\n5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,\nunder unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI\nis significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are\ngreatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the\nstudied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,\nrespectively.

However,\ndifferences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male\ndominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in\nmost roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce\ngender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt\nformulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms\nlike corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.\nSensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while\nFLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.\n  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic\nand model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt\nwording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results\nunderscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance\nto prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI."}

Within the\ncontext of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank\nadapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \\textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new\nframework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative\nlow-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior\napproaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes\nless important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,\nenabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by\nminimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning\nand recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded\ninterpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of\nstructured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight\nperturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based\npruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently\noutperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in\nmathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,\nand it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods\nacross diverse sparsity levels."}

This reliance creates a powerful yet\nfragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored\nrisk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that\nlook plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,\nclosely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,\nwe introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to\ngenerate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions\neventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and\namplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the\nmodel itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility\nregularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple\nbenchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with\nminimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human\nevaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated\nreasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.\nLeft unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers\nand undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future\nresearch into this alarming risk.

In this work, we introduce such a\nframework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show\nthat a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including\nReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation\nof existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,\npreventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,\nmale vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into\nseparate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To\naddress this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the\n$\\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the\nlargest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative\nactivations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.\nComprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks\nshow that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,\nand enables single features to encode contrasting concepts.
