With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA.

Howard", "Panos Stinis"], "title": "Bridging quantum and classical computing for partial differential equations through multifidelity machine learning", "comment": "19 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "Quantum algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs) face severe practical constraints on near-term hardware: limited qubit counts restrict spatial resolution to coarse grids, while circuit depth limitations prevent accurate long-time integration. These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics."}

Event cameras offer sparse, motion-driven sensing with low power consumption, but produce asynchronous event streams rather than RGB video. We propose a hybrid capture paradigm that records sparse RGB keyframes alongside continuous event streams, then reconstructs full RGB video offline -- reducing capture power consumption while maintaining standard video output for downstream applications. We introduce the Image and Event to Video (IE2Video) task: reconstructing RGB video sequences from a single initial frame and subsequent event camera data. We investigate two architectural strategies: adapting an autoregressive model (HyperE2VID) for RGB generation, and injecting event representations into a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model (LTX) via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion-based approach achieves 33\\% better perceptual quality than the autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS). We validate our approach across three event camera datasets (BS-ERGB, HS-ERGB far/close) at varying sequence lengths (32-128 frames), demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization with strong performance on unseen capture configurations."}

We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity.

Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, such as the Rainbow Deep Q-Network (DQN), improve scalability through prioritized replay and distributional heads, classical function approximators limit their representational power. We introduce Variational Quantum Rainbow DQN (VQR-DQN), which integrates ring-topology variational quantum circuits with Rainbow DQN to leverage quantum superposition and entanglement. We frame the human resource allocation problem (HRAP) as a Markov decision process (MDP) with combinatorial action spaces based on officer capabilities, event schedules, and transition times. On four HRAP benchmarks, VQR-DQN achieves 26.8% normalized makespan reduction versus random baselines and outperforms Double DQN and classical Rainbow DQN by 4.9-13.4%. These gains align with theoretical connections between circuit expressibility, entanglement, and policy quality, demonstrating the potential of quantum-enhanced DRL for large-scale resource allocation.

Nevertheless, LLM-driven generation remains challenging: the token-level design loop is discrete and non-differentiable, preventing feedback from smoothly guiding architectural improvement. These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached. Finally, Pareto-guided Evolutionary Selection effectively promotes architectures that jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, latency, confidence, and structural diversity. Across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet16-120, COCO-5K, and Cityscape, RevoNAD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Ablation and transfer studies further validate the effectiveness of RevoNAD in allowing practically reliable, and deployable neural architecture design."}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired framework well-suited to these challenges due to their natural ability to process discrete events and preserve millisecond-scale timing. This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return). These results validate the potential of spiking networks, when robustly tuned with task-specific objectives, for effective price spike forecasting in HFT."}

However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers. For conditional generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset using the LDM-4 model, our W4A4 and W4A3 quantization schemes improve the Inception Score by 12.8% and 467.73%, respectively, over the existing state-of-the-art method."}
