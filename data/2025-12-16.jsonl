Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance."}

The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches.

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference.

Unlike free-form generation, editing requires faithfully implementing user instructions while preserving unchanged content, as even minor unintended modifications can break functionality. Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes. HyperEdit achieves a 9%--30% relative improvement in BLEU on modified regions over state-of-the-art baselines, despite utilizing only 3B parameters."}

We present Unique, a unified MPC that cascades models of different fidelity within a single optimization: a short-horizon, high-fidelity model for accurate control, and a long-horizon, low-fidelity model for planning. We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon. In simulation and real flights, under equal computational budgets, Unique improves closed-loop position or velocity tracking by up to 75% compared with standard MPC and hierarchical planner-tracker baselines. Ablations and Pareto analyses confirm robust gains across horizon variations, constraint approximations, and smoothing schedules."}

This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions."}

This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023.

We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR.

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."}

If the data were stochastic, then one can show that $E_α$ has probability at least $1-α$ under a wide class of distributions (eg: sub-Gaussian, symmetric, variance-bounded, etc.). In fact, we show that on the Ville event $E_0$ of probability one, the regret on every path in $E_0$ is eventually bounded by $\\ln \\ln V_T$ (up to constants).

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities."}

As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events.

Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods.

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment."}

While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance."}

Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance.

To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge. This approach establishes a more robust and generalizable decision boundary.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity."}

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

To deal with this problem, in this work, we propose a novel Meta Cross-Task Unexploitable Example Generation (MCT-UEG) framework. At the core of our framework, to optimize the unexploitable example generator for effectively producing broadly unexploitable examples, we design a flat-minima-oriented meta training and testing scheme. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework."}

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as \"ground truth\", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods.

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment."}

However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD."}

Unlike free-form generation, editing requires faithfully implementing user instructions while preserving unchanged content, as even minor unintended modifications can break functionality. Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes. HyperEdit achieves a 9%--30% relative improvement in BLEU on modified regions over state-of-the-art baselines, despite utilizing only 3B parameters."}

We introduce a video to image aggregation strategy that spatially arranges multiple frames from each video into a single input image. This design enables the use of pre trained convolutional neural network backbones such as ResNet50 and avoids the computational overhead of complex video transformer models. We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model. Positive pairs are defined as projections from videos sharing the same label while all other projections are treated as negatives. Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video. Rather than relying on data augmentation these frame level variations produce diverse positive samples with global context and reduce overfitting. Experiments on the Penn Action and HMDB51 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in classification accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. The proposed Supervised Contrastive Frame Aggregation method learns effective video representations in both supervised and self supervised settings and supports video based tasks such as classification and captioning. The method achieves seventy six percent classification accuracy on Penn Action compared to forty three percent achieved by ViVIT and forty eight percent accuracy on HMDB51 compared to thirty seven percent achieved by ViVIT."}

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models).

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8.

However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities."}
