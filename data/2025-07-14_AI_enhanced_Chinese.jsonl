Moreover,\npatient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data\nacross institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which\nrely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient\nleakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is\nintegrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local\ndata, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios.

Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL\ntraining framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner\nacross clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data\nheterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.\nHowever, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting\nin heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge\nlearned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL\nframework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called\nSFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the\ncurrent round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled\nKnowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign\ndistinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based\non the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.\nThrough this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training\nefficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive\nexperiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in\nSFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SFedKD\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u51b3SFL\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "SFL\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSFedKD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "SFedKD\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709FL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SFedKD\u4e3aSFL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To collect\nessential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's\nPromoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained\napproximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their\nfield-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with\nSentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and\nirrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing\nDSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior\nknowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR\nadoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with\ndistrict-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)\nwith government records.

In general, risk-aversion leads\nto conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in\nconverging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,\nin some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an\nexploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic\n(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper\nconfidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a\nlocal lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value\nfunction. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value\nis increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint\nvalue. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the\nenvironment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety\nconstraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach\nprevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the\nreward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as\nSafety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment\nCityLearn.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e50\u89c2\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4fdd\u5b88\u63a2\u7d22\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "ORAC\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6210\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eORAC\u5728Safety-Gymnasium\u548cCityLearn\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "ORAC\u901a\u8fc7\u4e50\u89c2\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
