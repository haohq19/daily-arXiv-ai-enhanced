The\ndata were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier\nusing 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect\nintentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and\nterrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was\nhigher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on\nn-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal\nanalysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a\nperson's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were\nable to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could\nbe attributed to major events."}

However, these approaches require\nexplicit target sentences and do not support removing broader concepts, such as\npersons or events. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept Unlearning\n(CU) as a new requirement for LLM unlearning. We leverage knowledge graphs to\nrepresent the LLM's internal knowledge and define CU as removing the forgetting\ntarget nodes and associated edges. This graph-based formulation enables a more\nintuitive unlearning and facilitates the design of more effective methods. We\npropose a novel method that prompts the LLM to generate knowledge triplets and\nexplanatory sentences about the forgetting target and applies the unlearning\nprocess to these representations. Our approach enables more precise and\ncomprehensive concept removal by aligning the unlearning process with the LLM's\ninternal knowledge representations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic\ndatasets demonstrate that our method effectively achieves concept-level\nunlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge."}
