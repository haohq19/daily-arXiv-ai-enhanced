Solatorio"], "title": "Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN): A Protocol for Trustworthy Numeric Answers from LLMs via Claim Verification", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that\ndeviate from available data, a failure known as \\emph{numeric hallucination}.\nExisting safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and\nuncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:\nfabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose\n\\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that\nenforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric\nspans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a\nverifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,\nrounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places\nverification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers\nare marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation\nprevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before\ndisplay, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:\n\\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates\nuncertainty."}

In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly\nadopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale\nperception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,\naccurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In\nthis work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator\nfor event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid\nboard. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in\neKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and\nefficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be\naccurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization\nis conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The\nresults of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can\nachieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The\nimplementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at\n(https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community."}
