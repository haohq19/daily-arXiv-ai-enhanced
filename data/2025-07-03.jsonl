Code available at\n  https://github.com/dsb-ifi/SPoT", "summary": "Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization\nmethods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents\nmodels from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We\npropose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that\npositions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping\ngrid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover\nsubstantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,\ndrastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions\nduring inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and\ninterpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage\nrather than an imposed limitation."}
