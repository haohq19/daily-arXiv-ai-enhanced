This\nparadigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By\nreducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,\nexisting methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,\nfundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure\ndistribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We\npropose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar\nscore, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the\nintegral of its failure probability density function defined over a\nhigh-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows\nus to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,\ngradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a\nframework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven\nrefinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool\nof counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,\nand applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify\nmechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA\nbenchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower\ncost than strong baselines.

While deep learning models have advanced in network\narchitecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated\ndata. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal\ntasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random\nmixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the\nlack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose\nMS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that\nautomatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key\ncomponents of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)\nstrategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples\nwith contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module\nusing multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios\ndynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment\nAlignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across\nmodalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional\nregularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone\nnetwork jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six\nstate-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms\nexisting methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment\naugmentation.

However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodels, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to\ncatastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference\nconsistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing\nbehaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,\nthe routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated\nforward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout\nRouting Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the\ninference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces\ntraining-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies\nwithout compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings\nconfirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and\noutperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a\nnew solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models."}
