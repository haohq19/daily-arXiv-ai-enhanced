Here, we present a physics-inspired\ncooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the\ndissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a\ndecentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous\nformation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of\nexplicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended\npayload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to\nenergy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control\nsystem is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors\nof the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches\nunder the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and\npayload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying\nrobots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success\nrate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,\nand 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor\nwinds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges\nswarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable\nframework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex\ntransportation tasks in communication-constrained environments."}
