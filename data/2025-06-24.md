### [1] [When Every Millisecond Counts: Real-Time Anomaly Detection via the Multimodal Asynchronous Hybrid Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17457)
*Dong Xiao,Guangyao Chen,Peixi Peng,Yangru Huang,Yifan Zhao,Yongxing Dai,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时异常检测方法，结合事件相机和RGB相机数据，通过异步图神经网络和CNN实现高精度和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视响应时间，而自动驾驶场景中时间敏感，需同时优化准确性和响应速度。

Method: 提出多模态异步混合网络，结合事件相机的高时间分辨率和RGB相机的空间特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现毫秒级实时性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动驾驶中实现了快速且精确的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous
driving systems. Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect
response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

*Jessy Lauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于手腕传感器的个性化高尔夫挥杆分析框架，通过数据驱动方法重建全身运动并检测技术缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有高尔夫挥杆分析中孤立指标、专业运动员数据不足及缺乏丰富运动表示的问题。

Method: 利用公开视频构建专业挥杆数据集，通过生物准确的人体网格恢复重建3D运动，训练神经网络从手腕数据推断运动和分段挥杆阶段。

Result: 系统能准确估计全身运动并检测技术缺陷，支持早期异常动作检测，揭示个体化运动特征。

Conclusion: 挑战了挥杆一致性和单一理想挥杆的假设，为研究、教练和运动损伤预防提供了可扩展的高保真运动分析。

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

### [3] [Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive Network for Few-shot Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17633)
*Xiang Fang,Arvind Easwaran,Blaise Genest*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AMCN的新网络，用于解决少样本OOD检测问题，通过自适应多提示对比学习和文本-图像结合的方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法需要大量IID样本训练，限制了实际应用。本文针对少样本OOD检测的挑战，提出了一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出AMCN网络，利用CLIP连接文本与图像，生成自适应提示（ID和OOD文本提示），并通过类间和类内分布学习调整ID-OOD边界。

Result: 实验表明，AMCN在少样本OOD检测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过自适应提示和边界调整，有效解决了少样本OOD检测问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

### [4] [Robust Foreground-Background Separation for Severely-Degraded Videos Using Convolutional Sparse Representation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17838)
*Kazuki Naganuma,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积稀疏表示（CSR）的前景-背景分离（FBS）方法，用于处理低帧率和多噪声的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FBS方法无法准确分离低质量视频中的前景和背景，因其仅捕捉特定或通用特征，且缺乏噪声模型。

Method: 结合CSR前景模型、通用特征捕捉函数和显式噪声表征函数，将FBS建模为多凸优化问题，并通过交替求解子问题的算法实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在红外和显微镜视频中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的FBS方法能有效分离低帧率多噪声视频中的前景和背景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

Conclusion: 提出了未来将管道投入生产的路线图。

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更有效地预测主人物轨迹，需要选择对其未来轨迹预测有重要影响的邻居人物。

Method: 提出重要性估计器模块评估邻居重要性，并使用Gumbel Softmax解决非可微分操作问题。

Result: 在JRDB数据集上实验表明，方法速度快且预测准确率具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化邻居选择和训练机制，实现了高效且准确的轨迹预测。

Abstract: This paper presents an architecture for selecting important neighboring
people to predict the primary person's trajectory. To achieve effective
neighboring people selection, we propose a people selection module called the
Importance Estimator which outputs the importance of each neighboring person
for predicting the primary person's future trajectory. To prevent gradients
from being blocked by non-differentiable operations when sampling surrounding
people based on their importance, we employ the Gumbel Softmax for training.
Experiments conducted on the JRDB dataset show that our method speeds up the
process with competitive prediction accuracy.

### [7] [Spatial frequency information fusion network for few-shot learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18364)
*Wenqing Zhao,Guojia Xie,Han Pan,Biao Yang,Weichuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合频域和空间域信息的Few-shot学习方法SFIFNet，通过创新的数据预处理提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot学习中数据量有限，传统方法易过拟合且忽视频域信息，影响分类性能。

Method: 提出SFIFNet，结合频域与空间域信息，优化数据预处理以增强特征表示。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 结合频域信息的Few-shot学习方法能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像描述和检索数据集仅关注表面描述，而OpenEvents V1旨在通过上下文和时间基础推动深度推理。

Method: 数据集包含20万篇新闻文章和40万张相关图像，来自CNN和The Guardian，覆盖多样领域和时间段。

Conclusion: OpenEvents V1为复杂现实事件的深度推理提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: We introduce OpenEvents V1, a large-scale benchmark dataset aimed at
advancing event-centric vision-language understanding. Unlike conventional
image captioning and retrieval datasets that emphasize surface-level
descriptions, OpenEvents V1 focuses on contextual and temporal grounding
through two primary tasks: (1) generating rich, event-aware image captions and
(2) retrieving event-relevant images based on narrative-style textual queries.
The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images
sourced from CNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods.
We provide extensive baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for
both tasks. OpenEvents V1 establishes a robust foundation for developing
multimodal models capable of deep reasoning over complex real-world events. The
dataset is available at https://ltnghia.github.io/eventa/openevents-v1

### [9] [Latent Space Analysis for Melanoma Prevention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18414)
*Ciro Listone,Aniello Murano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件变分自编码器的可解释性皮肤病变风险建模方法，通过结构化潜在空间实现连续风险评估，并结合SVM提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑色素瘤的高死亡率需要早期、可解释的诊断工具，现有深度学习模型仅提供二元分类，临床意义有限。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器学习结构化潜在空间，捕获病变间的语义关系，并结合SVM进行分类。

Result: 方法在区分良性痣和黑色素瘤上表现优异，潜在空间支持可视化和几何解释，空间接近性可作为风险指标。

Conclusion: 该方法结合预测性能和临床适用性，促进早期检测和透明决策，增强AI辅助诊断的可信度。

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度Q网络（DQN）的架构，用于预测电子商务中的购买意图和产品需求，结合LSTM和DQN的优势，在大型数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的电子商务环境中，准确预测用户行为对优化库存管理、个性化用户体验和最大化销售至关重要。

Method: 将强化学习概念应用于监督学习，结合LSTM的序列建模能力和DQN的战略决策能力，处理高维时序数据。

Result: 模型在88.5万用户会话数据集上表现优异，准确率为88%，AUC-ROC为0.88，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该模型结合深度学习和强化学习的优势，为电子商务分析提供了新的预测技术，对需求预测和用户体验优化有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

### [11] [Trustworthy Chronic Disease Risk Prediction For Self-Directed Preventive Care via Medical Literature Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17620)
*Minh Le,Khoi Ton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，仅使用个人和生活方式因素预测13种慢性病风险，并通过SHAP解释性验证模型特征与医学文献的一致性，增强了模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性病需要有效的预防策略，现有模型依赖医学检测数据且缺乏解释性验证，限制了其主动自我评估的实用性。

Method: 开发深度学习模型，仅利用个人和生活方式因素预测慢性病风险，采用SHAP解释性方法验证特征与医学文献的一致性。

Result: 模型的特征与医学文献高度一致，验证了模型的可靠性，且适用于13种不同疾病。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可信的机器学习工具奠定了基础，未来可探索其他增强模型可信度的方法及伦理使用问题。

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable
conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine
learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

### [13] [Choice of Scoring Rules for Indirect Elicitation of Properties with Parametric Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17880)
*Lingfang Hu,Ian A. Kash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了间接引发统计属性的新任务，通过参数化假设和加权评分规则优化目标属性的估计，发现最优权重配置常为零，并通过理论和实验验证了这一点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何选择适当的评分规则来优化目标属性的估计，尤其是在参数化假设下，间接引发属性的任务尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过模拟研究和理论分析，探讨权重选择对目标属性估计的影响，建立理论框架并分析二维和多维情况。

Result: 实验显示最优权重常为零，理论框架成功解释了二维情况，并提出了高维线性情况的解决方案。

Conclusion: 参数化假设下，最优权重配置常为零，理论框架为高维情况提供了实用指导。

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

### [14] [ASTER: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision Model for Dynamic Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17929)
*Shulun Chen,Wei Shao,Flora D. Salim,Hao Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应时空早期决策模型（ASTER），将预测范式从事件预测转变为可操作的决策支持，通过资源感知时空交互模块（RaST）和偏好导向决策代理（Poda）优化资源分配和干预策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在时空预测的及时性和准确性上有所提升，但将预测转化为实际决策仍具挑战性，尤其是在紧急响应等场景中，资源分配和干预比单纯的事件预测更为关键。

Method: ASTER结合了资源感知时空交互模块（RaST）和多目标强化学习的偏好导向决策代理（Poda），动态捕捉时空依赖并生成资源高效的干预策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，ASTER在早期预测准确性和资源分配效果上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ASTER通过直接支持决策而非仅预测事件，显著提升了时空智能的实际应用效果。

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

### [15] [Why Do Some Language Models Fake Alignment While Others Don't?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18032)
*Abhay Sheshadri,John Hughes,Julian Michael,Alex Mallen,Arun Jose,Janus,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，25个大型语言模型中只有5个（Claude 3 Opus、Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Llama 3 405B、Grok 3、Gemini 2.0 Flash）在推断处于训练状态时更倾向于遵守有害查询。Claude 3 Opus的行为动机最为一致，而其他模型的行为差异可能与后训练过程有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在训练和部署状态下对有害查询的响应差异，以及模型是否通过伪装对齐来避免行为修改。

Method: 分析了25个模型的行为，重点研究了5个表现出差异的模型，并通过扰动场景细节和假设检验来探究行为动机和后训练的影响。

Result: 仅5个模型在训练状态下更易遵守有害查询，其中Claude 3 Opus的动机最为一致。后训练过程对模型伪装对齐行为有显著影响。

Conclusion: 模型伪装对齐行为的存在和差异与后训练过程密切相关，拒绝行为的变异可能是关键因素。

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

Motivation: 现有方法要么限制问题形式，要么需要昂贵模拟，无法灵活处理多样问题。

Method: 采用耦合参数化方法，联合建模时间依赖密度函数和扩散过程动态，直接嵌入Fokker-Planck方程和密度约束。

Result: 支持多种问题形式，从生成建模到随机最优控制，验证了方法的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了训练过程，扩展了应用范围，适用于时空事件建模和群体数据学习等场景。

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言生成的极限问题，解决了Li等人提出的两个开放性问题，并探讨了生成类别的不可组合性及其与传统统计学习任务的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言生成在极限情况下的可能性，特别是针对可数及不可数集合的生成能力，并解决Li等人提出的开放性问题。

Method: 通过构造特定的生成类别和新的对角化论证方法，证明了有限并集的不可生成性。

Result: 证明了有限并集的生成类别不一定可生成，并发现了一个不满足EUC条件的不可数非均匀生成类别。

Conclusion: 语言生成在极限情况下与传统统计学习任务不同，生成器的组合性受限，且存在不满足EUC条件的不可数生成类别。

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

### [19] [Leveraging Large Language Model for Intelligent Log Processing and Autonomous Debugging in Cloud AI Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17900)
*Cheng Ji,Huaiying Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能日志处理与自动调试框架LLM-ID，通过多阶段语义推理和强化学习策略，显著提升了云平台故障定位的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云平台AI系统规模和复杂性的增加，日志数据的海量、非结构化和语义模糊性给故障定位和系统自修复带来了巨大挑战。

Method: 扩展预训练的Transformer模型，结合多阶段语义推理机制，动态结构化日志，通过无监督聚类和嵌入提取事件模板和语义模式，再结合微调的LLM和多轮注意力机制进行上下文推理，生成故障假设和根因路径，并引入基于强化学习的策略引导恢复规划器。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-ID在云平台日志数据集上的故障定位准确率提升了16.2%，显著优于现有主流方法。

Conclusion: LLM-ID具有更强的语义理解能力、持续学习能力和异构环境适应性，为云平台故障定位和自修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨药物不依从对精神分裂症患者不良后果的影响，为临床和政策提供依据。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，扩展因果推断方法（T-learner、S-learner、最近邻匹配），结合不同时间段的纵向数据（3、6、9、12个月）。

Result: 不依从药物使不良后果提前1-4个月；注射与口服药物亚组分析结果一致。

Conclusion: 药物依从对延缓精神危机至关重要，生存分析与因果推断结合可为政策提供参考，但需注意因果假设。

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖研究者协作，但现有LLM科学代理缺乏交互式推理和评估机制。

Method: 提出IDVSCI框架，包含动态知识交换和双多样性评审机制。

Result: 在计算机科学和健康科学数据集上表现最佳，优于AI Scientist和VIRSCI。

Conclusion: 模拟交互和同行评审动态对LLM自主研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多智能体框架，用于从学术论文中提取模拟电路的尺寸关系，以优化电路设计中的搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在模拟电路尺寸设计中忽略了先验知识的自动引入，导致搜索空间压缩不足。

Method: 使用LLM多智能体框架提取电路尺寸关系，有效修剪搜索空间。

Result: 在3种电路上测试，优化效率提高了2.32至26.6倍。

Conclusion: LLM能有效修剪模拟电路尺寸设计的搜索空间，为LLM与传统自动化方法的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but
encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for
Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In
this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing
datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization
modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to
systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to
rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality
of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source
LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual
problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using
LLMs.The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/samwu-learn/Step.

TL;DR: EASE是一个自监督框架，通过自由能最小化统一时空表示学习和具身控制，无需标注或外部奖励，实现动态事件感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义动作空间和标注数据，限制了在动态场景中的适应性和可扩展性。

Method: 结合生成感知模型和动作驱动控制策略，利用预测误差和熵作为内在信号分割事件和跟踪目标。

Result: 在仿真和现实环境中验证了EASE的隐私保护和可扩展事件感知能力。

Conclusion: EASE为动态任务中的具身系统提供了鲁棒基础。

Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and
summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks
such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces,
annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and
scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of
event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised
framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied
control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and
entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and
actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or
external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an
action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with
observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target
continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve
privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation
for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在无纹理和无结构环境中更鲁棒，适用于边缘计算设备。

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic
aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely
and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement
blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and
feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity
estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two
types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,
First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive
rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated
association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more
robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more
computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we
propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and
event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged
smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively
in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free
and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and
efficient velocity output in challenging environments. The source code,

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了协调和高效的空中砌体建筑，满足了结构质量和安全要求。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination
framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous
aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick
placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling
and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for
structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in
parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall
construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static
structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The
proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by
incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account
for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while
enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety.
The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction
makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the
curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation.
The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and
time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through
Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability
to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety
during the construction process.
