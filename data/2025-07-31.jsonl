To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our\nbenchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses\nholistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on\nVGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further\nresearch. The code and data is available at:\nhttps://github.com/katariaak579/GEMS"}

Existing approaches to\nreconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,\nsemantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose\nCapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level\nsemantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate\nfeatures without image reconstruction.\n  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating\nstrong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up\nto 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from\nResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis\nfurther reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more\nsemantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,\nwe introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to\nintermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.\nExperimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without\nadditional training costs."}
