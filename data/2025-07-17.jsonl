We then analyse sixty-three\nthousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population\ndataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride\nlength, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle\nentropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a\nResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the\nknee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.\nFinally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,\nwe compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer\nperceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks\nachieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1\nseconds.

We test our hypothesis in\nthe game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human\nintent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\\% F1 score and over\n80\\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through\nmotion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals\nfor intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.\nFurthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to\nvalidate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data\nlabelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques\nfor sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior\nanalysis across various fields."}

M.Z. and P.F. contributed equally to this work and share\n  senior authorship", "summary": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of\nextremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables\naccurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive\nfreezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for\nsite-level implementation and future federated learning deployments."}
