Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced\ndistribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall\nevents are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models\nfrom effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,\nwe treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,\nidentifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the\nprimary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a\nlong-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events\nthrough a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \\geq $ 50 mm/6 h,\nDPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical\nWeather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067.

CVP allows users to\ndefine a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive\nlow-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that\nexplicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph\nacts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring\nits decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing\nlogical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic\nexperiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift\nbetween the training and test environments.

We introduce a dual-network design\nthat uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the\ndynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the\nmodel errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide\nexploration.

To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting\n(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary\noptimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our\napproach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns\nglobal and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and\nadaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.\nFurthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where\natmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to\nspecialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the\nmodel's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional\nforecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble\nforecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over\nstate-of-the-art methods across all four tasks."}

However, existing models and benchmarks\nfail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video\ngeneration. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured\nevaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four\ndisentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.\nTogether, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in\nindustry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts\naligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for\nprompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation\nof each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+\nmodels and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals.
