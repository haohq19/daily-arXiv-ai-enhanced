However, existing works rarely support whole-body\njoint-level teleoperation for humanoid robots, limiting the diversity of tasks\nthat can be accomplished. This work presents Controller for Humanoid Imitation\nand Live Demonstration (CHILD), a compact reconfigurable teleoperation system\nthat enables joint level control over humanoid robots. CHILD fits within a\nstandard baby carrier, allowing the operator control over all four limbs, and\nsupports both direct joint mapping for full-body control and loco-manipulation.\nAdaptive force feedback is incorporated to enhance operator experience and\nprevent unsafe joint movements. We validate the capabilities of this system by\nconducting loco-manipulation and full-body control examples on a humanoid robot\nand multiple dual-arm systems. Lastly, we open-source the design of the\nhardware promoting accessibility and reproducibility. Additional details and\nopen-source information are available at our project website:\nhttps://uiuckimlab.github.io/CHILD-pages."}

Object-Centric Process Mining as the Enabler for Generative, Predictive, and Prescriptive Artificial Intelligence", "comment": "10 pages, 4 figures, preprint keynote paper of the seventh\n  International Conference on Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems (INFUS 2025)", "summary": "The uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the way we work, interact,\ndo business, and conduct research. However, organizations struggle to apply AI\nsuccessfully in industrial settings where the focus is on end-to-end\noperational processes. Here, we consider generative, predictive, and\nprescriptive AI and elaborate on the challenges of diagnosing and improving\nsuch processes. We show that AI needs to be grounded using Object-Centric\nProcess Mining (OCPM). Process-related data are structured and\norganization-specific and, unlike text, processes are often highly dynamic.\nOCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different\nforms of AI. We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the\namalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a\nvariety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context.\nThis paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and\nhighlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative,\npredictive, and prescriptive AI."}

This paper has been accepted for presentation at\n  the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems\n  (IROS 2025)", "summary": "Collective decision-making is a key function of autonomous robot swarms,\nenabling them to reach a consensus on actions based on environmental features.\nExisting strategies require the participation of all robots in the\ndecision-making process, which is resource-intensive and prevents the swarm\nfrom allocating the robots to any other tasks. We propose Subset-Based\nCollective Decision-Making (SubCDM), which enables decisions using only a swarm\nsubset. The construction of the subset is dynamic and decentralized, relying\nsolely on local information. Our method allows the swarm to adaptively\ndetermine the size of the subset for accurate decision-making, depending on the\ndifficulty of reaching a consensus. Simulation results using one hundred robots\nshow that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to using the entire swarm\nwhile reducing the number of robots required to perform collective\ndecision-making, making it a resource-efficient solution for collective\ndecision-making in swarm robotics."}

Unlike frame-based\ncameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,\ncapturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based\nmethods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully\nexploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.\nTherefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement\npipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure\nrefinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with\namplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude\nand phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy\nwith dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by\nthe temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to\nrefine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility\nrestoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to\nsimulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact\ndegradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model\nto learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models."}

To address these limitations, we\npropose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for\nanomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts\nper-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud\nextractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better\ncaptures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal\ndynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism\nthat leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn\ntemporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all\nfeature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian\nspace rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmultiple anomaly categories, with a 7\\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a\n5.6\\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released\nupon paper acceptance."}
