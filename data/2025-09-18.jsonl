Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot\nrobustness tests overlook the reality that environments evolve and that models,\nif left unchallenged, can drift into maladaptation (e.g., reward hacking,\nover-optimization, or atrophy of broader capabilities). We argue that an\nantifragile approach -- Rather than striving to rapidly reduce current\nuncertainties, the emphasis is on leveraging those uncertainties to better\nprepare for potentially greater, more unpredictable uncertainties in the future\n-- is pivotal for the long-term reliability of open-ended ML systems. In this\nposition paper, we first identify key limitations of static testing, including\nscenario diversity, reward hacking, and over-alignment. We then explore the\npotential of antifragile solutions to manage rare events.
