Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are\nwidely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as\nGraph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture,\nwhich mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for\nstatic graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networks with undirected\nedges. However, financial transaction networks are inherently dynamic, with\nevolving structures and directed edges representing the flow of money. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce DynBERG, a novel architecture that\nintegrates Graph-BERT with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture\ntemporal evolution over multiple time steps. Additionally, we modify the\nunderlying algorithm to support directed edges, making DynBERG well-suited for\ndynamic financial transaction analysis. We evaluate our model on the Elliptic\ndataset, which includes Bitcoin transactions, including all transactions during\na major cryptocurrency market event, the Dark Market Shutdown. By assessing\nDynBERG's resilience before and after this event, we analyse its ability to\nadapt to significant market shifts that impact transaction behaviours. Our\nmodel is benchmarked against state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification\napproaches, such as EvolveGCN and GCN, demonstrating superior performance,\noutperforming EvolveGCN before the market shutdown and surpassing GCN after the\nevent. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the critical role of\nincorporating a time-series deep learning component, showcasing the\neffectiveness of GRU in modelling the temporal dynamics of financial\ntransactions."}

However, they exhibit only a superficial comprehension of\nreal-world anomalies, with limited breadth in complex principles and subtle\ncontext that distinguish the anomalies from normalities, e.g., climbing cliffs\nwith safety gear vs. without it. To this end, we introduce CueBench, the first\nof its kind Benchmark, devoted to Context-aware video anomalies within a\nUnified Evaluation framework. We comprehensively establish an event-centric\nhierarchical taxonomy that anchors two core event types: 14 conditional and 18\nabsolute anomaly events, defined by their refined semantics from diverse\ncontexts across 174 scenes and 198 attributes. Based on this, we propose to\nunify and benchmark context-aware VAU with various challenging tasks across\nrecognition, temporal grounding, detection, and anticipation. This also serves\nas a rigorous and fair probing evaluation suite for generative-discriminative\nas well as generalized-specialized vision-language models (VLMs). To address\nthe challenges underlying CueBench, we further develop Cue-R1 based on R1-style\nreinforcement fine-tuning with verifiable, task-aligned, and hierarchy-refined\nrewards in a unified generative manner. Extensive results on CueBench reveal\nthat, existing VLMs are still far from satisfactory real-world anomaly\nunderstanding, while our Cue-R1 surpasses these state-of-the-art approaches by\nover 24% on average."}

In this paper, we address this issue from a\nmulti-modal perspective and find that fake images cannot be properly aligned\nwith corresponding captions compared to real images. Upon this observation, we\npropose a simple yet effective detector termed ITEM by leveraging the\nimage-text misalignment in a joint visual-language space as discriminative\nclues. Specifically, we first measure the misalignment of the images and\ncaptions in pre-trained CLIP's space, and then tune a MLP head to perform the\nusual detection task. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical misalignment\nscheme that first focuses on the whole image and then each semantic object\ndescribed in the caption, which can explore both global and fine-grained local\nsemantic misalignment as clues.

As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher\ninto a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching\nDistillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges\narise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons: (1)\nbridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to\ninfinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error\naccumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in\ncomputational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is\nintroducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with\nattention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV\ncache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time\nextrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation\nof arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in\nmotion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster,\nuniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint\ntrajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in\nreal-time, delivering a truly interactive experience."}
