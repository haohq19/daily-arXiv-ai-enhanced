Inspired by cognitive theories of\nevent perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised\nframework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied\ncontrol through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and\nentropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and\nactively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or\nexternal rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an\naction-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with\nobservations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target\ncontinuity, and adaptability to novel environments.

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization\nproblem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex\nsubproblems by newly established algorithms.

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results.

While prior work has improved the timeliness and\naccuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into\nactionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the\ndecoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can\nsignificantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency\nresponse, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not\njust incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive\nSpatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting\nparadigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework\nensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby\nmaximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new\nResource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively\ncaptures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,\nproducing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate\nactionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent\n(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms\npredictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving\noptimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.\nExperimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction\naccuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u7a7a\u65e9\u671f\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\uff08ASTER\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08RaST\uff09\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bfc\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u7406\uff08Poda\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "ASTER\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08RaST\uff09\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bfc\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u7406\uff08Poda\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cASTER\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "ASTER\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional\nimage captioning and retrieval datasets that emphasize surface-level\ndescriptions, OpenEvents V1 focuses on contextual and temporal grounding\nthrough two primary tasks: (1) generating rich, event-aware image captions and\n(2) retrieving event-relevant images based on narrative-style textual queries.\nThe dataset contains over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images\nsourced from CNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods.\nWe provide extensive baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for\nboth tasks. OpenEvents V1 establishes a robust foundation for developing\nmultimodal models capable of deep reasoning over complex real-world events.
