To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time\naround 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers\nfeel they made the biggest impact on the robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e3b\u52a8\u5206\u4eab\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u4e00\u7ec4\u9694\u79bb\u53cd\u5e94\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7ec4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5171\u4eab\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53cd\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u60c5\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff08200ms\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "200ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u975e\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff1b100ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

Previous SSCL\nefforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this\nwork presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically\nenhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for\nLP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping\nold classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer\nPseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels\nacross both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)\nClass-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's\noutputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to\nprevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL\nmethods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its\neffectiveness.

Survival\nanalysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts\nfor patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study\nperiod, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events\nthat prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks\nare often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a\nlimited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates\nwhy treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in\nsurvival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,\ncritically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of\nmisclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in\nsurvival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error\nand demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and\nalgorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles\nacross demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially\nexacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical\nanalysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing\nrisks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,\npotentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting\nthe fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks\nas censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of\nsurvival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve\naccuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream\ndecisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u622a\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u751f\u5b58\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bef\u5dee\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5230\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u5e38\u88ab\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u622a\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u5b58\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u52a0\u5267\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5c06\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u622a\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}
