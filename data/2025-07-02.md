### [1] [Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation via Discrepancy-Weighted Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00042)
*Xinrun Xu,Jianwen Yang,Qiuhong Zhang,Zhanbiao Lian,Zhiming Ding,Shan Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ER-EMU算法，通过自适应经验回放解决边缘模型在动态交通环境中因灾难性遗忘导致的知识丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态交通环境（如昼夜变化）中，边缘模型在适应新数据分布时会遗忘旧知识，现有方法无法高效利用历史数据。

Method: ER-EMU结合FIFO经验缓冲区和基于域距离度量的经验选择算法（DDM-ES），优先选择与当前域差异大的历史数据。

Result: 在Bellevue交通视频数据集上，ER-EMU显著提升了多种云边协作目标检测框架的性能。

Conclusion: ER-EMU通过优化历史数据选择和缓冲管理，有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型适应性。

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于YOLOv7和YOLOv8的植物病害检测系统，通过迁移学习方法实现对细菌、真菌和病毒病害的准确识别，YOLOv8表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物病害对农业造成严重影响，早期检测至关重要，技术发展为自动化监测提供了可能。

Method: 使用YOLOv7和YOLOv8模型，通过迁移学习对植物叶片图像数据集进行微调，检测多种病害。

Result: 模型性能指标（mAP、F1-score、Precision、Recall）分别为91.05、89.40、91.22和87.66，YOLOv8表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该系统为植物病害早期检测提供了高效、可扩展的自动化解决方案，有助于提高作物产量和可持续农业。

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

### [3] [Box-QAymo: Box-Referring VQA Dataset for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00525)
*Djamahl Etchegaray,Yuxia Fu,Zi Huang,Yadan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box-QAymo是一个用于评估和微调视觉语言模型（VLMs）的数据集和基准，专注于用户指定对象的时空推理，通过边界框和层次化评估协议提升模型在自动驾驶中的解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶导向的VQA数据集局限于全场景描述或路径点预测，无法评估VLMs对局部用户驱动查询的响应能力，因此需要更贴近真实场景的数据集。

Method: 引入Box-QAymo数据集，用户通过绘制边界框表达意图，采用层次化评估协议，包括基础能力测试、属性预测、运动理解和时空推理。

Result: 当前VLMs在感知问题上的表现存在显著局限性，揭示了与现实世界性能的差距。

Conclusion: Box-QAymo为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶系统奠定了基础，支持真实条件下的用户交互。

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

### [4] [Overtake Detection in Trucks Using CAN Bus Signals: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00593)
*Fernando Alonso-Fernandez,Talha Hanif Butt,Prayag Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过分析卡车CAN总线数据，评估了三种分类器（ANN、RF、SVM）用于超车检测的性能，发现多车数据训练和分数级融合策略能显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卡车安全超车对防止事故和交通效率至关重要，ADAS需要准确预测超车行为以做出及时决策。

Method: 使用Volvo提供的五辆卡车CAN总线数据，评估ANN、RF和SVM三种分类器，并分析不同预处理配置对性能的影响。

Result: 多车数据训练提升泛化能力，分数级融合策略在多数情况下表现最佳，最终实现TNR=93%和TPR=86.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据多样性和多车训练的重要性，为ADAS超车检测提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and
ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is
essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and
informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks
provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle
manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing
configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic
conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the
no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks
adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,
real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,
training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces
condition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification
accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per
vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields
the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an
accuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True
Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which
explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to
understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera
Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional
exterior mirrors.

### [5] [De-Simplifying Pseudo Labels to Enhancing Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00608)
*Zehua Fu,Chenguang Liu,Yuyu Chen,Jiaqi Zhou,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出DeSimPL方法，通过减少训练中简单样本的比例，提升自标记检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通场景中目标检测需要大量标注数据，无监督域适应（UDA）成为研究热点。自标记方法虽简单高效，但性能不及域对齐方法，原因是训练中简单样本比例过高（简单标签偏差）。

Method: 提出DeSimPL方法，利用实例级记忆库更新伪标签，并引入对抗样本增加样本多样性，同时采用自适应加权损失避免后期训练中伪标签的误报问题。

Result: 实验表明，DeSimPL显著减少简单样本比例，提升自标记检测器性能，并在四个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DeSimPL通过解决简单标签偏差问题，显著提升了自标记检测器的性能，为UDA目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and
transportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in
acquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention.
UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which
achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity
due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the
limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate
performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high
proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as
the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo
Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level
memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then,
adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering
from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the
proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant
performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments
conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.

### [6] [Rectifying Magnitude Neglect in Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00698)
*Qihang Fan,Huaibo Huang,Yuang Ai,ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了线性注意力（Linear Attention）性能下降的原因，并提出了一种改进方法MALA，通过融入查询（Query）的幅度信息，使其更接近Softmax Attention的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然复杂度低，但性能显著低于Softmax Attention。研究发现其忽略了查询的幅度信息，导致注意力分布无法动态适应。

Method: 提出Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA)，在线性注意力中融入查询的幅度信息，使其分布更接近Softmax Attention。

Result: MALA在图像分类、目标检测、自然语言处理等多个任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MALA通过改进线性注意力的计算方式，显著提升了性能，同时保持了线性复杂度。

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent
global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its
applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar
formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling
efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers
from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax
Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based
on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,
Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.
This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the
Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax
Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score
distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear
Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully
incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an
attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while
exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of
MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,
instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,
speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on
all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

### [7] [Surgical Neural Radiance Fields from One Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00969)
*Alberto Neri,Maximilan Fehrentz,Veronica Penza,Leonardo S. Mattos,Nazim Haouchine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合术前MRI数据和术中单张图像，利用神经风格迁移技术实现快速单图像NeRF训练，解决了术中多视图数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在术中场景中因多视图数据需求受限，本研究旨在利用单张术中图像和术前数据实现高效训练。

Method: 利用术前MRI数据定义相机视角，通过神经风格迁移（结合WTC2和STROTSS）将术中图像风格迁移至训练集，实现快速单图像NeRF训练。

Result: 在四个神经外科案例中验证，与真实手术显微镜图像训练的NeRF模型相比，重建保真度和风格对齐度高。

Conclusion: 证明了单图像NeRF训练在手术场景中的可行性，克服了传统多视图方法的限制。

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

Abstract: We utilize dynamical modes as features derived from Continuous Glucose
Monitoring (CGM) data to detect meal events. By leveraging the inherent
properties of underlying dynamics, these modes capture key aspects of glucose
variability, enabling the identification of patterns and anomalies associated
with meal consumption. This approach not only improves the accuracy of meal
detection but also enhances the interpretability of the underlying glucose
dynamics. By focusing on dynamical features, our method provides a robust
framework for feature extraction, facilitating generalization across diverse
datasets and ensuring reliable performance in real-world applications. The
proposed technique offers significant advantages over traditional approaches,
improving detection accuracy,

*Corbeau Michael,Claeys Emmanuelle,Serrurier Mathieu,Zaraté Pascale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较不同数据生成方法（如随机采样、变分自编码器、生成对抗网络等）在消防员干预场景中的效果，提出领域特定指标评估合成数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化消防员资源分配需依赖模拟场景，传统评估指标难以满足合成数据的复杂需求。

Method: 比较多种数据生成方法，结合领域特定指标（如响应时间分布、时空分布）和标准指标（如Wasserstein距离）评估数据质量。

Result: 发现数据分布高度不平衡且非高斯分布，增加了数据生成的复杂性。

Conclusion: 领域特定指标能更有效评估合成数据的实用性和相关性。

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case
of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to
experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the
global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then
mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare
different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular
Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are
examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of
firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in
capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world
scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is
conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the
firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance.
Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal
distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are
designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex
correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the
conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational
relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of
being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian
distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

### [10] [MamNet: A Novel Hybrid Model for Time-Series Forecasting and Frequency Pattern Analysis in Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00304)
*Yujun Zhang,Runlong Li,Xiaoxiang Liang,Xinhao Yang,Tian Su,Bo Liu,Yan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MamNet模型结合时域建模和频域特征提取，显著提升了网络流量异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络流量异常波动可能预示安全威胁或系统故障，需高效预测与检测方法保障网络安全。

Method: MamNet通过Mamba模块（时域建模）和傅里叶变换（频域特征提取）捕捉流量长期依赖与周期性波动，融合多尺度信息增强异常检测能力。

Result: 在UNSW-NB15和CAIDA数据集上，MamNet在准确率、召回率和F1-Score上优于主流模型，复杂流量和长期趋势检测性能提升2%-4%。

Conclusion: MamNet能有效捕获多时间尺度的流量异常，适用于网络安全与流量管理。未来可通过引入外部事件信息进一步优化模型。

Abstract: The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security
threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and
anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic
management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly
detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and
frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term
dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain
modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using
Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion
layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to
detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and
CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream
models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an
improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex
traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that
MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time
scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and
traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by
incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's
adaptability and stability in complex network environments.

*Haresh Rengaraj Rajamohan,Xiang Gao,Weicheng Zhu,Shih-Lun Huang,Long Chen,Kyunghyun Cho,Cem M. Deniz,Narges Razavian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对电子健康记录（EHR）的生成式预训练策略，通过预测下一次就诊事件来学习患者历史数据，并在不进行任务特定微调的情况下展示了与现有方法相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练在语言和其他数据类型中取得了成功，但在医疗健康领域的结构化EHR数据中潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 采用基于下一次就诊事件预测的自回归生成模型，处理异构数据类型的联合预测，并引入对重复事件的预测正则化。

Result: 模型在零样本预测中，对痴呆和膝关节骨关节炎的发病率预测表现与完全微调的Transformer基线相当。

Conclusion: 该策略能够捕捉复杂的临床依赖关系，无需昂贵的任务特定微调，为EHR数据的预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data
types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured
electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining
strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model
learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the
next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction
of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on
predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation
model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when
new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is
evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee
osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals
a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that
our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly
task-specific fine-tuning.

*Taeyoun Kim,Fahim Tajwar,Aditi Raghunathan,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TARS的方法，通过自适应分配计算资源来训练LLM，以提升其在安全漏洞方面的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用自适应推理方法提升LLM在安全领域的表现，并验证其有效性。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）方法，结合链式思维追踪和平衡安全与任务完成的奖励信号，设计TARS训练框架。

Result: TARS训练的模型在模糊查询上分配更多计算资源，实现了更好的安全性与拒绝平衡，并提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TARS为训练LLM抵御越狱和有害请求提供了一种有效的开放方法。

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,
harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many
refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning
capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive
behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better
safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish
between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box
(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an
effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful
requests by reasoning per prompt.

*Dongyoon Hahm,Woogyeol Jin,June Suk Choi,Sungsoo Ahn,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CIP的新技术，利用因果影响图（CID）来识别和减轻自主代理决策中的风险，从而提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主代理在辅助任务中展现潜力，确保其行为安全可靠变得至关重要，以避免意外后果。

Method: 方法包括三个步骤：1）基于任务规范初始化CID以描述决策过程；2）利用CID指导代理与环境交互；3）根据观察到的行为和结果迭代优化CID。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在代码执行和移动设备控制任务中显著提升了安全性。

Conclusion: CIP通过结构化因果关系表示，有效增强了自主代理的安全性，为未来研究提供了实用框架。

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.
