Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,\ndemonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation\napproach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where\nsafety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and\nintuitive robotic control in high-risk environments."}

These models are often trained on\nnumerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic\ncreations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and\ndistribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a\ntraining-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating\nvideos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those\nconcepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly\nintegrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:\nSelective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise\nGuidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including\nobject erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content\nerasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms\nprior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and\ngeneralizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nsuppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on\naverage across four tasks compared to baselines."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model\ninitially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch\nthat switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and\nnonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also\npossesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable\nstable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,\nthe model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and\ndesirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The\nresults give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches\nas computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent\narchitectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic\ncomputing.

To address this, we\npropose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task\nplanning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as\na digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500\ncomplex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.\nWe provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning\nstrategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based\non diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our\nbenchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent\nassessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control\npolicy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R\nbridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic\nbenchmarking of language-guided robotic agents."}
