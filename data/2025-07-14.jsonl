This\npaper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions\nbetween attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The\nframework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form\ngame, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while\nanticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI\nsolution, the \"Purple Agent,\" which integrates adversarial exploration and\ndefensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple\nAgent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes\nproactively to prevent harmful outputs.

Although clinicians visually observe movement\nimpairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure\nmovement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical\nmeasurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or\nearlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics\nLaboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for\ndata collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this\ndata. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,\nclinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of\nour system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle\nerrors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,\nlower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to\nbeing easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability\nand were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals\nundergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a\ncommon patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics\ncorrelated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical\nintervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use\nof handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing\nclinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward\naccessible monitoring of mobility impairments.

Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL\ntraining framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner\nacross clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data\nheterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.\nHowever, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting\nin heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge\nlearned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL\nframework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called\nSFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the\ncurrent round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled\nKnowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign\ndistinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based\non the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.\nThrough this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training\nefficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive\nexperiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in\nSFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods."}

Sustainable\nirrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and\ndrying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping\nsecure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a\nkey component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited\ndata on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking\nand targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework\nto monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a\nregion facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect\nessential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's\nPromoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained\napproximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their\nfield-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with\nSentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and\nirrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing\nDSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior\nknowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR\nadoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with\ndistrict-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)\nwith government records.

In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the\nforgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local\noverfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input\nspace. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without\nconventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent\nphenomenon.\n  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages\nthe training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten\nknowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by\ndistilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing\nperformance without added inference cost.\n  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and\ntraining regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach.
