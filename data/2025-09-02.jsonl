We provide a\nmodel-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of\nclosed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search\nand 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source\nmodel (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20\nrounds of search.

When\nworking with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions\ncaused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography\nand the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial\ndistortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When\nconsidering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are\nthree conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)\ndistortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and\n(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been\naddressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and\nunified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed\napproach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal\nsolvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed\nsolvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining\nsimilar accuracy.

This provides an interesting use\ncase to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in\nthe vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation\nbased on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how\npedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into\nthe implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and\nacceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,\na model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction\n(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,\nit is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and\ndecision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used\nframework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept\nfor an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model\nto learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL\nagent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a\nrisk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model\nlearned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and\nthereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the\nmodelled pedestrian.

Tasks\nwith similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming\nclusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:\nfor each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are\ndirectly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from\ndifferent tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation\n(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT\ntraining phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing\ncore regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting.
