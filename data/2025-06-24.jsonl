Inspired by cognitive theories of\nevent perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised\nframework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied\ncontrol through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and\nentropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and\nactively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or\nexternal rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an\naction-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with\nobservations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target\ncontinuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in\nsimulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve\nprivacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation\nfor embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks."}

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively.

More importantly, the learned\nlatent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with\nthe spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful\nindicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical\napplicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and\nenhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable\ndecision-making."}

In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and\nfeature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity\nestimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two\ntypes of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,\nFirst, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive\nrotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated\nassociation process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more\nrobust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more\ncomputationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we\npropose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and\nevent-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged\nsmoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively\nin self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free\nand association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and\nefficient velocity output in challenging environments.

Q. Chen"], "title": "Simulation-Free Differential Dynamics through Neural Conservation Laws", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time\ndiffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods\ntypically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which\nonly works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive\nsimulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from\nthe diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which\njointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the\ndynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To\naccomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and\ndensity function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly\nsimplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables\nsimulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from\ndata-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal\ntransport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,\nwith straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of\naccessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of\napplication domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal\ndynamics from population data."}
