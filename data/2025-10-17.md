<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的OCC系统存在比特率低、处理负载高等限制，而现有事件相机OCC系统使用的传统调制方案未能充分利用事件相机的独特特性。

Method: 提出事件间隔调制(EIM)方案，通过调制事件之间的间隔来传输信息；优化事件相机参数以适应EIM；实验确定EIM的最大调制阶数；基于获得的参数进行传输实验。

Result: 在室内环境中成功实现了28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的传输速率，创下了事件相机OCC系统的比特率新纪录。

Conclusion: EIM调制方案能够充分利用事件相机的异步特性和高动态范围，显著提高了事件相机OCC系统的传输性能，为高速可见光通信提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IPRO方法，通过强化学习优化视频扩散模型，解决图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当人脸只占图像小部分且表情动作变化大时，这对人类感知很关键

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号和KL散度正则化稳定训练

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效增强图像到视频生成中的人脸身份保持能力

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Envision an AI capable of functioning in human-like settings, moving beyond
mere observation to actively understand, anticipate, and proactively respond to
unfolding events. Towards this vision, we focus on the innovative task where,
given ego-streaming video input, an assistant proactively answers diverse,
evolving questions at the opportune moment, while maintaining synchronized
perception and reasoning. This task embodies three key properties: (1)
Proactive Coherence, (2) Just-in-Time Responsiveness, and (3) Synchronized
Efficiency. To evaluate and address these properties, we first introduce
ESTP-Bench (Ego Streaming Proactive Benchmark) alongside the ESTP-F1 metric-a
novel framework designed for their rigorous assessment. Secondly, we propose a
comprehensive technical pipeline to enable models to tackle this challenging
task. This pipeline comprises: (1) a data engine, (2) a multi-stage training
strategy, and (3) a proactive dynamic compression technique. Our proposed model
effectively addresses these critical properties while outperforming multiple
baselines across diverse online and offline benchmarks. Project

### [5] [Efficient Video Sampling: Pruning Temporally Redundant Tokens for Faster VLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14624)
*Natan Bagrov,Eugene Khvedchenia,Borys Tymchenko,Shay Aharon,Lior Kadoch,Tomer Keren,Ofri Masad,Yonatan Geifman,Ran Zilberstein,Tuomas Rintamaki,Matthieu Le,Andrew Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和修剪时间静态补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度，实现更快推理和更长输入序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性，长视频经常超出现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: 引入高效视频采样(EVS)，识别并修剪时间静态补丁——在连续帧间保持不变的空间区域。该方法保留位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练，可与随机修剪率的上训练阶段结合使用。

Result: EVS在推理时将大型语言模型的首次令牌时间(TTFT)减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。结合上训练后，模型对不同程度的压缩具有鲁棒性，在激进修剪下仍能保持完整性能。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

### [6] [MoCom: Motion-based Inter-MAV Visual Communication Using Event Vision and Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14770)
*Zhang Nengbo,Hann Woei Ho,Ye Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉运动信号的MAV群通信框架，模仿蜜蜂摇摆舞，使用事件相机和SNN进行低功耗通信解码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV群中面临频谱拥塞、干扰和高功耗问题，需要寻找更可靠的替代方案

Method: 使用四种运动基元作为控制符号，通过事件相机捕获MAV飞行模式，结合事件帧分割模型和轻量级SNN进行动作识别和解码

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现良好

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV群在受限环境中的通信提供了能量高效的替代方案

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

### [7] [Exploratory Causal Inference in SAEnce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14073)
*Tommaso Mencattini,Riccardo Cadei,Francesco Locatello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Neural Effect Search方法，直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，无需预设假设，在真实世界科学试验中首次实现无监督因果效应识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机对照试验依赖人工假设且分析成本高，限制了大规模因果效应估计，可能遗漏重要发现

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将非结构化数据转化为有意义的表示，通过稀疏自编码器解释，采用递归分层策略解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，在实验生态学背景下首次在真实世界科学试验中成功识别无监督因果效应

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接从数据中发现未知因果效应，突破了传统RCT的限制，为大规模因果发现提供了新途径

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

### [8] [Stable Prediction of Adverse Events in Medical Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14286)
*Mayank Keoliya,Seewon Choi,Rajeev Alur,Mayur Naik,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，特别关注风险轨迹的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期事件预测系统忽略风险评分的稳定性评估，且主要基于表格数据，缺乏对多模态输入和时间稳定性的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 现有方法（特别是LLMs）难以同时优化准确性和稳定性，在高精度操作点召回率表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

*Kartikay Agrawal,Abhijeet Vikram,Vedant Sharma,Vaishnavi N.,Ayon Borthakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（尖峰谐波共振放电状态空间模型），这是一种用于超长序列建模的乘法自由、能量高效的二阶尖峰状态空间模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合尖峰神经网络（SNNs）的能量效率和状态空间模型（SSMs）在长序列建模中的优势，开发一种适合资源受限应用的乘法自由模型。

Method: 设计二阶尖峰SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，并首次提出基于核的尖峰回归器用于超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比二阶ANN-based SSMs节省73倍能量，在50k序列上仍保持优越性能，平均表现优于transformer或一阶SSMs。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM在保持性能的同时显著提高了能量效率，特别适合资源受限的超长序列建模应用。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过平衡熵信号在rollout和策略更新阶段的使用，解决了Agentic RL中过度依赖熵信号导致的训练崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流Agentic RL算法在熵信号指导下自主探索高不确定性工具调用步骤，但过度依赖熵信号会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监控自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并引入熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO始终优于7种主流RL算法。仅使用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B在AEPO下取得显著成果：GAIA Pass@1 47.6%，Humanity's Last Exam 11.2%，WebWalker Pass@1 43.0%；GAIA Pass@5 65.0%，Humanity's Last Exam 26.0%，WebWalker Pass@5 70.0%。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持策略熵稳定，促进了可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为低功耗在线异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别适用于需要严格控制误报率和低功耗的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G多RAT网络中，蜂窝和WiFi发射器共存，传统切换决策在快速信道动态、干扰和异构覆盖下不可靠，需要更智能的切换方案。

Method: 基于模型驱动和短时域信号质量预测的ML辅助P-CHO框架，使用RAT感知LSTM网络预测移动用户信号质量指标，采用滞后条件决策逻辑。

Conclusion: 提出的P-CHO框架适用于6G多RAT部署中的ML辅助切换引导，能够实现可靠、主动的切换决策。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Motivation: 当前多智能体AI系统的通信协议碎片化，存在语义鸿沟，无法进行严格的系统属性分析，存在架构错位和可被利用的协调问题等风险。

Method: 引入两个基础模型：主机智能体模型（负责与用户交互、任务分解和协调执行）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务从创建到完成的状态转换）。

Conclusion: 这是首个严格基础的、领域无关的框架，用于系统分析、设计和部署正确、可靠、鲁棒的多智能体AI系统。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像预测文化遗产地退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现76.9%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境应力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用

Method: 采用PerceiverIO架构，简化编码器（64D潜在空间）防止小数据集过拟合，使用自适应Barlow Twins损失鼓励模态互补性

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比传感器单独方法提升15.4%，比图像单独方法提升30.7%

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文综述了神经符号AI中的推理捷径问题，讨论了其成因、后果，并回顾了现有的理论特征和应对方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号AI模型在概念未被直接监督时容易出现推理捷径，这会损害模型解释性、分布外性能及可靠性。现有文献分散，需要统一视角来帮助研究者理解和解决这一问题。

Method: 通过温和介绍推理捷径，直观讨论其成因和后果，回顾现有理论特征，详细阐述包括缓解和意识策略在内的应对方法。

Result: 提供了推理捷径的统一视角，阐明了现有方法的优缺点，降低了研究者处理这一问题的门槛。

Conclusion: 这篇综述有助于开发更可靠的神经符号AI和可信赖的AI模型，通过整合分散的文献为研究者提供了系统性的理解框架。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

### [16] [Serialized EHR make for good text representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13843)
*Zhirong Chou,Quan Qin,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对医疗领域的预训练基础模型，通过将电子健康记录序列化来更好地捕捉临床事件间的时序依赖关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格化、事件化特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配问题，限制了捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 通过基于SciBERT在结构化电子健康记录序列上进行额外预训练，设计SerialBEHRT模型来编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的电子健康记录表示策略实现了更优越且更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 时序序列化在医疗基础模型预训练中具有重要意义，SerialBEHRT展示了通过领域对齐方法能够产生更丰富的患者表示。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在药物安全预测中会基于社会人口学信息产生系统性偏见，弱势群体被预测更高的不良事件风险，存在显性和隐性两种偏见模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在药物安全预测中是否会将临床无关的社会人口学信息纳入考虑，评估其在实际部署中的公平性风险。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据，基于人物角色评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B模型在不同教育、婚姻、就业等社会属性下的预测表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确度差异，弱势群体（如低教育、住房不稳定）被预测更高的不良事件可能性；识别出显性偏见（推理中直接引用人物属性）和隐性偏见（预测不一致但未提及属性）两种模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重偏见风险，需要在临床部署前建立公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: Qwen3Guard是一个多语言安全护栏模型系列，包含生成式和流式两个变体，解决了现有安全模型在细粒度分类和实时监控方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两个主要问题：1) 只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；2) 需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，无法与流式LLM推理兼容。

Method: 开发了两个专门变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转化为指令跟随任务，实现细粒度三分类；流式Qwen3Guard引入词元级分类头，支持实时安全监控。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全调节解决方案，所有模型均在Apache 2.0许可下公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: 提出了Beyond One World基准测试，用于评估LLM在多版本角色扮演中的表现，包含30个英雄的90个版本，测试事实回忆和道德困境处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在忠实、一致地扮演特定版本角色方面能力不足，特别是面对漫威、DC等拥有多版本角色的超级英雄宇宙时。

Method: 构建包含30个标志性英雄90个版本的基准测试，包含两个任务：经典事件（事实回忆）和道德困境（伦理场景）。提出Think-Act Matching指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能改善弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要挑战；模型通常擅长思考或行动中的一项而非两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署中常因分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，不适用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：预填充阶段和定期间隔优化路由决策，通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits，保持计算效率。

Result: 在推理任务上获得一致性能提升，HumanEval上提升5.5%，与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效优化MoE路由决策，提升模型性能，同时保持对上下文偏移的鲁棒性，并与现有测试时扩展技术自然互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.
