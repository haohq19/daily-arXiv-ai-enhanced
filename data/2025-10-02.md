### [1] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了6种先进开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见，发现所有模型都存在系统性的职业刻板印象，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意应用中如何嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是医疗职业中的性别表征问题。

Method: 使用精心设计的提示词，为5种医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析6种开源模型的性别表征模式。

Result: 所有模型都显示系统性职业刻板印象：护士全为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型表现各异，Qwen-Image和SDXL强制男性主导，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性，提示词修饰语显著影响性别平衡。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型中的性别偏见既系统又模型特定，提示词措辞对人口统计结果起关键作用，需要偏差感知设计、平衡默认值和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象的强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [2] [Relative-Absolute Fusion: Rethinking Feature Extraction in Image-Based Iterative Method Selection for Solving Sparse Linear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00500)
*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RAF（相对-绝对融合）特征提取技术，通过同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征与对应数值作为绝对特征，增强基于图像的选择方法，解决特征模糊问题，提高稀疏线性系统求解方法选择的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图像的选择方法虽然前景广阔，但其特征提取技术可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致相同选择和次优方法，因此需要改进特征提取以避免特征模糊。

Method: 引入RAF特征提取技术，同时提取和融合图像表示（相对特征）与对应数值（绝对特征），创建全面的矩阵表示，防止不同矩阵间的特征模糊。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和自建BMCMat数据集上的综合评估显示，稀疏线性系统求解时间减少0.08s-0.29s，比传统基于图像的选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过相对-绝对特征融合有效解决了基于图像选择方法中的特征模糊问题，显著提高了稀疏线性系统求解方法选择的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [3] [Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681)
*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种事件-图像知识蒸馏框架，通过CLIP教师模型指导事件学生模型，实现事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，结合SNN和CNN的混合框架自适应提取事件特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机缺乏纹理和颜色信息，现有事件检测方法局限于预定义类别，无法泛化到新物体。CLIP等视觉语言模型在RGB图像上实现了开放词汇检测，但无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的视觉表示。设计SNN-CNN混合框架，SNN自适应确定事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法成功将CLIP的语义理解能力迁移到事件数据，实现了事件相机的开放词汇目标检测，克服了事件数据缺乏纹理信息的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架有效弥合了图像和事件数据之间的模态差距，SNN-CNN混合设计保留了关键时间信息，为事件相机的开放词汇检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

### [4] [Federated Learning Meets LLMs: Feature Extraction From Heterogeneous Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00065)
*Abdelrhman Gaber,Hassan Abd-Eltawab,Youssif Abuzied,Muhammad ElMahdy,Tamer ElBatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align是一个联邦学习框架，利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，解决表格数据异构性问题，无需手动模式对齐，在保持隐私的同时提升性能并降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域很有吸引力，但表格数据的异构性（不同模式和特征空间）阻碍了直接聚合，需要解决模式差异问题。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，使用DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa、ClinicalBERT等LLM模型提取语义对齐的嵌入表示，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测任务中，所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络下均优于现有方法，F1分数提升最高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%，在极端模式差异下表现稳健。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align为异构环境下的联邦学习提供了一个鲁棒、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

### [5] [PrunedLoRA: Robust Gradient-Based structured pruning for Low-rank Adaptation in Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00192)
*Xin Yu,Cong Xie,Ziyu Zhao,Tiantian Fan,Lingzhou Xue,Zhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrunedLoRA：利用结构化剪枝从过参数化初始化中获得高代表性低秩适配器的新框架，在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解任务中优于LoRA及其变体


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的参数高效微调能力通常落后于全参数微调，关键问题是如何从过参数化空间中获得表达能力强的低秩适配器

Method: 通过结构化剪枝动态修剪不重要组件并防止其重新激活，实现灵活的自适应秩分配。使用基于梯度的剪枝策略，最小化整体损失的剪枝误差

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解任务中持续优于LoRA及其变体，在不同稀疏度水平下也优于现有结构化剪枝方法

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA提供了从过参数化空间获得表达性低秩适配器的有效方法，通过理论分析和实证验证证明了其优越性

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

### [6] [DecepChain: Inducing Deceptive Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00319)
*Wei Shen,Han Wang,Haoyu Li,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecepChain是一种新型后门攻击方法，通过诱导LLMs生成看似合理但最终得出错误结论的推理链，这种攻击难以被人类察觉且能保持良性场景的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs依赖思维链进行推理，但这种依赖为攻击者创造了脆弱的基础。攻击者可以诱导模型生成看似合理但最终错误的推理过程，这种隐蔽的攻击方式会破坏人类对LLM推理的信任。

Method: 利用LLMs自身的幻觉，通过微调模型在自然错误推理上的表现，然后使用GRPO（组相对策略优化）配合翻转奖励和合理性正则化器来强化攻击效果，同时保持推理过程的流畅性和合理性外观。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，同时在良性场景上性能下降最小。人类评估显示参与者难以区分被操纵的推理过程和良性推理。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式会悄悄破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，强调了未来研究这一警示性风险的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

### [7] [AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404)
*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，揭示了现有SAE变体的局限性，并提出了AbsTopK SAE来支持双向概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏理论推导框架，且其正则化器强制非负性，无法表示双向概念（如男性vs女性），导致语义轴分裂为冗余特征。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法建立理论框架，提出AbsTopK SAE变体，基于ℓ₀稀疏约束对最大幅度激活进行硬阈值处理，保留正负激活。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重建保真度、增强了解释性，并能用单个特征编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过支持双向激活，提供了更丰富、更完整的语义表示，解决了现有SAE的结构性限制。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

### [8] [Neural Diffusion Processes for Physically Interpretable Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00733)
*Alessio Cristofoletto,Cesare Rollo,Giovanni Birolo,Piero Fariselli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFHT是一个生存分析框架，将深度神经网络与随机过程理论中的首次命中时间分布相结合，通过潜在扩散过程建模事件时间，提供封闭形式的生存和风险函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存分析方法如Cox回归假设比例风险，无法捕捉时变风险。需要结合深度学习的表达能力与随机过程理论的物理可解释性来建模复杂系统中的生存现象。

Method: 将事件时间表示为潜在扩散过程首次到达吸收边界的时间，使用神经网络将输入变量映射到FHT过程的物理参数（初始条件、漂移、扩散），基于布朗运动等随机过程构建模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，DeepFHT在预测准确性上与最先进方法相当，同时保持了基于物理的可解释参数化，能够阐明输入特征与风险之间的关系。

Conclusion: 随机过程理论与深度学习的结合为复杂系统中生存现象的建模提供了原则性途径，实现了预测准确性与物理可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

TL;DR: 使用自编码器提升低振幅信号质量的研究，特别是针对引力事件等微弱信号，显著提高了信噪比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善低振幅信号（如引力事件）的质量，这些信号通常受到多种干扰源的影响，难以分析。

Method: 使用预先存在的自编码器，利用宇宙事件数据进行训练，优化其架构和参数。

Result: 处理后的信号信噪比显著增加，证明了自编码器在分析具有多重干扰源的微弱信号方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 自编码器在提升低振幅信号质量方面具有显著效果，为分析微弱信号提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This brief study focuses on the application of autoencoders to improve the
quality of low-amplitude signals, such as gravitational events. A pre-existing
autoencoder was trained using cosmic event data, optimizing its architecture
and parameters. The results show a significant increase in the signal-to-noise
ratio of the processed signals, demonstrating the potential of autoencoders in
the analysis of small signals with multiple sources of interference.

*Tao Ren,Jinyang Jiang,Hui Yang,Wan Tian,Minhao Zou,Guanghao Li,Zishi Zhang,Qinghao Wang,Shentao Qin,Yanjun Zhao,Rui Tao,Hui Shao,Yijie Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RiskPO方法，用风险度量替代传统均值目标，通过混合风险价值目标增强困难实例的梯度信号，防止过度自信收敛，在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成任务上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理能力提升有限的问题，原因是过度强调高概率输出序列而忽略了稀有但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出RiskPO方法：1）使用混合风险价值目标，整合奖励分布的多个区域；2）设计捆绑方案，将多个问题聚合为捆绑包以丰富反馈信号；3）理论上证明风险规避更新能缓解熵崩溃并促进探索。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均一致且显著优于GRPO及其变体。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了一个严谨有效的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Diego Ortiz Barbosa,Mohit Agrawal,Yash Malegaonkar,Luis Burbano,Axel Andersson,György Dán,Henrik Sandberg,Alvaro A. Cardenas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出使用具身AI和大型视觉语言模型为自主无人机提供实时情境推理和自适应决策能力，以应对突发事件的紧急降落需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手动编写大量恢复规则，无法预见现实世界中的各种意外情况且容易变得不完整，需要更智能的自适应决策方案。

Method: 利用具身AI和大型视觉语言模型，在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，让无人机动态解读周围环境并决定紧急机动策略以实现安全降落。

Result: 结果显示具身AI能够实现一类以前无法手动设计的自适应恢复和决策流程。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自主空中系统的韧性和安全性，为无人机应急响应提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

*Jieun Yu,Minjung Park,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用SMOTE技术解决加密货币市场中Pump and Dump操纵检测的类别不平衡问题，结合集成学习模型显著提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场中Pump and Dump操纵事件的稀缺性导致严重的类别不平衡，阻碍了准确的检测。

Method: 应用合成少数类过采样技术(SMOTE)并评估先进的集成学习模型，以区分操纵性交易行为与正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提高了所有模型检测P&D事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的高召回率，具有强大的F1分数和快速计算性能。

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法结合可显著改善操纵活动的早期检测，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult是一个临床医生对齐的专家组合架构，将紧凑的PRISM序列模型扩展为路由式领域专家家族，通过轻量级路由器将急诊病例分发到不同专科模型，实现参数效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个安全、可审计、低延迟的临床咨询系统，通过领域专家模型提高诊断准确性，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 使用结构化临床事件标记化，轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分发到专科模型（心脏血管、肺部、胃肠、肌肉骨骼、心理源性），每个专家继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实世界急诊科队列中，专家模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高质量路由和大量计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模安全、可审计、低延迟的临床咨询提供了实用路径，并概述了外部/时间复制、非对称生命威胁阈值和多标签仲裁等验证步骤以满足前瞻性临床部署标准。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

TL;DR: 提出了ManagerBench基准，用于评估LLM在现实管理场景中的决策安全性与实用性权衡，发现前沿LLM在安全-实用权衡方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注防止生成有害内容，但忽视了当操作目标与人类安全冲突时，代理采取有害行动的风险。

Method: 创建包含人类验证的管理场景，每个场景都要求在实用但有害的行动与安全但操作性能较差的行动之间做出选择，并设置平行对照组来测量模型的实用主义倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全-实用性权衡方面表现不佳，许多模型为推进操作目标而持续选择有害选项，而其他模型则因避免伤害而变得过于安全且无效。

Conclusion: LLM在操作目标与对齐价值激励冲突行动时的安全决策能力存在挑战，这种错位源于优先级排序的缺陷而非伤害感知能力不足。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

TL;DR: 提出了可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，通过识别、擦除和重新生成错误推理步骤，显著提升了搜索增强大语言模型在复杂多跳推理中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索增强大语言模型在复杂多跳推理中可靠性有限，主要面临三个挑战：分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误，其中任一阶段的失败都会影响最终答案。

Method: ERL框架明确识别错误步骤，擦除它们并在原处重新生成推理，防止有缺陷的逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 使用ERL训练的ESearch模型在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle上取得显著提升，3B模型比之前SOTA提升8.48% EM和11.56% F1，7B模型提升5.38% EM和7.22% F1。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为大语言模型中的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

### [17] [A Novel Robust Control Method Combining DNN-Based NMPC Approximation and PI Control: Application to Exoskeleton Squat Movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00188)
*Alireza Aliyari,Gholamreza Vossoughi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合NMPC-DNN-PI控制器，将神经网络近似的非线性模型预测控制与PI控制器结合，解决了传统NMPC计算量大和NMPC-DNN在未知条件下鲁棒性差的问题，并在外骨骼机器人上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NMPC计算负载重，难以应用于机器人系统；而基于深度神经网络的NMPC近似方法在遇到意外干扰或与训练数据不同的工况时缺乏鲁棒性，导致跟踪误差大。

Method: 首次将NMPC-DNN输出与PI控制器结合，形成混合NMPC-DNN-PI控制器。开发了具有三个主动关节（踝、膝、髋）的人机动力学模型，使用超过530万个训练样本训练DNN。

Result: 在DNN未见过的条件下，混合NMPC-DNN-PI的跟踪误差显著低于NMPC-DNN。使用外骨骼后人体关节扭矩大幅降低，踝、膝、髋关节的RMS值分别减少了30.9%、41.8%和29.7%。混合控制器的计算成本比NMPC降低了99.93%。

Conclusion: 混合NMPC-DNN-PI控制器在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了鲁棒性，有效降低了人体关节负荷，为复杂动态系统的鲁棒非线性控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its
heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some
studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks
(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when
operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,
leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,
the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The
proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during
squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited
attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic
model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than
5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,
under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI
is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are
greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the
studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,
respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is
99.93% lower than that of NMPC.

Abstract: After years of growth, drone-based delivery is transforming logistics. At its
core, real-time 6-DoF drone pose tracking enables precise flight control and
accurate drone landing. With the widespread availability of urban 3D maps, the
Visual Positioning Service (VPS), a mobile pose estimation system, has been
adapted to enhance drone pose tracking during the landing phase, as
conventional systems like GPS are unreliable in urban environments due to
signal attenuation and multi-path propagation. However, deploying the current
VPS on drones faces limitations in both estimation accuracy and efficiency. In
this work, we redesign drone-oriented VPS with the event camera and introduce
EV-Pose to enable accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for accurate
drone landing. EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose
estimation module that extracts a temporal distance field to enable 3D point
map matching for pose estimation; and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and
optimization scheme to enhance the above estimation in accuracy and efficiency,
by utilizing drone motion in the \textit{early stage} of event filtering and
the \textit{later stage} of pose optimization. Evaluation shows that EV-Pose
achieves a rotation accuracy of 1.34$\degree$ and a translation accuracy of
6.9$mm$ with a tracking latency of 10.08$ms$, outperforming baselines by
$>$50\%, \tmcrevise{thus enabling accurate drone landings.} Demo:
