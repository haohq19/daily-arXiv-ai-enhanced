Key principles: (1) event as\nan act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models\n(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -\nthe order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)\nmaking the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring\ndeterminism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what\nfalls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the\ndeclarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of\nfixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms\n(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of\nhistory (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special\nattention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via\nschemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)\nwithout global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea\nsystem - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical\nconstructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language).

Key principles: (1) event as\nan act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models\n(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -\nthe order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)\nmaking the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring\ndeterminism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what\nfalls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the\ndeclarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of\nfixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms\n(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of\nhistory (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special\nattention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via\nschemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)\nwithout global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea\nsystem - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical\nconstructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The\nformalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,\nDLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from\ndifferent subjects)."}

Most existing\napproaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit\nassignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via\ndirect regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and\nmodel collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic\nframework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)\nreward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable\nintermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability\nmechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy\nupdates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before\ninfluencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme\nthat extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model\ndiversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on\nStable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human\npreference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally\nefficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without\ncompromising generative quality, diversity, or stability."}

This review\nprovides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with\nneural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based\nmethods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation\n(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder\nscalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that\nrely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample\nefficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can\neffectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP\nin neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for\nbiology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and\nfeedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological\nlearning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain\nlearns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based\non the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,\nsecond-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how\nthese methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training\nand the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to\nview biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO\nparadigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.\nThis framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence\nbut also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design\nfast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise."}

One such\nchallenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores\nfrom a specified range without any references. We first show that this\nchallenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias,\ni.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges,\npreventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar\nbiases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias\nthrough contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on\naverage in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score\nranges."}

Causality prevents access\nto future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens\nto grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing\napproaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill\nunchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage\nframework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable\nlatency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects\ntokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing\nper-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per\nframe instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in\n4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,\nkeeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments\ndemonstrate our method achieves $15.7\\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\\times$\nlower peak memory and $2\\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.\nStreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods\nwith an average of $63.8\\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\\%/3.7$ on RVS.\nThese results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for\nefficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth."}

Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on\nHM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time\nlatency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our\ncode will be released soon."}
