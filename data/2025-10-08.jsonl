Considering the impressive\nperformance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive\nplanning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective\ngoal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented\nconversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to\ndialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate\ninformation in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part\ninformational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating\nintermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational\ncomponents corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible\nconfigurations for these informational components lead to limited information\nstates. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information\nstates and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.\nEventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is\nimplemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database\nqueries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of\nretrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables\npassing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of\ncongruency.

However, a critical gap\nremains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing\nits deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal\nquery execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and\nauditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic\nretrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust\nreference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable\ncausal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex\nqueries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer\narchitecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,\nauditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for\nhigh-stakes domains."}

While linear attention reduces this to linear\ncomplexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,\nprohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert\npre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid\napproaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We\nidentify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the\nlinear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics\nreveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation\npractices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure\nbalanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only\nconversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining\nattention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled\nSliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax\nbranch during training to prevent component collapse.

For instance, repeated sampling has been shown\nto increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding\nproblems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such\nas being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability\nand safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when\nscaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?\nThis question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of\nmillions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent\nharms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find\nthat standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical\nshortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited\nscenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust\nestimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more\naccurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling\nstrategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these\ninnovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a\nfraction of the computational cost."}

The\ndataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from\ndocumented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and\nSeptember 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.\nWe estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing\none-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional\nsize cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our\nresults show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure\nhailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm\nfor the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting\nimproves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these\noff-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail\nsensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social\nmedia imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather\nevents.

However,\nfor end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames\nresults in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as\nvideo length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods\nimprove the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical\nchallenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in\nlong videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex\nhierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address\nthese issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and\nclusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed\nVideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving\ntemporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely\nlocate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy\noptimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of\nthe VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree\nstructures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while\nbeing guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge.
