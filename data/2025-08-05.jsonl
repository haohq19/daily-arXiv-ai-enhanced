In this paper, we enhance LMPC with\nthree key innovations:~(1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights\ntime-optimal tracking against centerline adherence,~(2)~a shifted local safe\nset to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates,\nand~(3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints\nwithout the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame\ntransformations.

However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows\nand static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -\nlimiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world\ndriving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection.

While random forest showed more\nvariability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which\nmay be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway\nemerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh\ndriving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual\nvariation.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

Chu", "Zhidong Li", "Evan Webster", "Ashley Rootsey"], "title": "The Complexity of Extreme Climate Events on the New Zealand's Kiwifruit Industry", "comment": "Pre-print v0.8 2025-08-04", "summary": "Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather\nevents, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry\nworldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.\nWe propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,\nspecifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit\nharvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant\nimpacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate\nmonitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an\nunsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded\nextreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals\nconsiderable variability in how different types of extreme event affect\nkiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes\nand individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights\ncritical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in\naccurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need\nfor integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with\nclimate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble\nmethods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station\nfeatures to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of\nextreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies."}

This assumption\nsimplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and\nlimiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel\ntraining strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from\nuncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the\nneed for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,\nwhich assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which\nstabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss\ncovariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.\nCoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method\ntrainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2\nwith two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nconsistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to\nanomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all\ndatasets."}

This\napproach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including\ncardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a\npreclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it\nsharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease\n(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the\ntranslational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening\nmodality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for\nearly personalized risk stratification.

The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating\nlarge-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community\ncollaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this\napproach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four\ntimes as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,\nand has received multiple contributions across industry and research.

In this work, we\nintroduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that\nsystematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual\nmonitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for\nembodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system\nfirst decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program\ngrounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed\nin simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected\ncheckpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure\nreasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events\nwith VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and\nrepairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting\nprogram synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that\nHyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of\nrobot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating\nmultimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines."}
