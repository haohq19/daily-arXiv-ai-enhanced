However, their reliance\non expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,\nparticularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS\n(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera\ninput, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the\ncollision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and\nestimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs\nlike YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,\ndetection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features\nextracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,\nthe robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in\nobject detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor\nattack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike\nexisting attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox\nsubtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in\ndataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting\ndownstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized\nin the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with\nonly a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.\nFurthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning\nstrategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in\ndownstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially\nresulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether."}

To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models.

However, most existing\nattack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer\nfrom limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness\nagainst common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel\nadversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and\nundefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)\nrepresentations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting\npoint clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point\nclouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric\nstructure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,\nMAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain\neffective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting\nand prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the\noptimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and\nundefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and\nundefendability.

Generating multi-human\ncontextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among\nhuman-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input\nand convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate\nmulti-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.\nSpecifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a\ndynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a\nwell-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we\nsynthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial\nguidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive\ncontext, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the\nretrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale\nand with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of\ncontextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our\nframework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code\nand benchmark, along with result videos, are available at our project page:\nhttps://rms0329.github.io/Event-Driven-Storytelling/."}

To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object\ndetection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,\neffective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task\nstill remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream\nDetection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information\nfrom both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its\nLiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input\nwhile the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An\nadditional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV\nmapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing\ncomprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused\nand fed to a detection head for 3D object detection.

Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/", "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.
