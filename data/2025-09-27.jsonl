The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time.

In this paper, we introduce Federated\nFlow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under\nprivacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each\nclient trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving\nprivacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,\nwhich employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within\neach client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we\npropose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of\noptimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates\ncouplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that\nFFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow\nstraightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance\ncomparable to the centralized baseline."}

However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the\nonline mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously\nexploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and\nenhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models\nnot only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing\nschedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria\nare introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time\ntraining, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,\nthus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical\nenvironments."}

Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit\ncontinuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to\nintroducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this\nend, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs\nCross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by\nprojecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,\nenabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to\nneighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner\nState-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and\nreduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and\nlarge-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four\ndatasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract\nsurgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in\nreconstruction performance and efficiency.
