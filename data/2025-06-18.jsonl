In recent work, morpho-transition has been studied from a model-based control perspective, but these approaches remain limited due to unmodeled dynamics and the requirement for planning through contacts. Here, we train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller to learn a morpho-transition policy and demonstrate successful transfer to hardware. We find that the RL control policy achieves agile landing, but only transfers to hardware if motor dynamics and observation delays are taken into account. On the other hand, a baseline MPC controller transfers out-of-the-box without knowledge of the actuator dynamics and delays, at the cost of reduced recovery from disturbances in the event of unknown actuator failures. Our work opens the way for more robust control of agile in-flight quadrotor maneuvers that require mid-air transformation."}

While LLM-based conversational recommender systems (CRSs) have attracted attention for their ability to enhance the quality of recommendations, limited research has addressed the implicit integration of recommendations within customer support interactions. In this work, we introduce ImpReSS, an implicit recommender system designed for customer support conversations. ImpReSS operates alongside existing support chatbots, where users report issues and chatbots provide solutions. Based on a customer support conversation, ImpReSS identifies opportunities to recommend relevant solution product categories (SPCs) that help resolve the issue or prevent its recurrence -- thereby also supporting business growth. Unlike traditional CRSs, ImpReSS functions entirely implicitly and does not rely on any assumption of a user's purchasing intent. Our empirical evaluation of ImpReSS's ability to recommend relevant SPCs that can help address issues raised in support conversations shows promising results, including an MRR@1 (and recall@3) of 0.72 (0.89) for general problem solving, 0.82 (0.83) for information security support, and 0.85 (0.67) for cybersecurity troubleshooting. To support future research, our data and code will be shared upon request."}

For example in TRC, we need to understand the temporal semantic differences between the following two questions that are lexically near-identical: \"What finished right before the decision?\" or \"What finished right after the decision?\". To discern the two questions, existing solutions have relied on answer overlaps as a proxy label to contrast similar and dissimilar questions. However, we claim that answer overlap can lead to unreliable results, due to spurious overlaps of two dissimilar questions with coincidentally identical answers. To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that elicits proper reasoning behaviors through a module for predicting time spans of events. We introduce the Timeline Reasoning Network (TRN) operating in a two-step inductive reasoning process: In the first step model initially answers each question with semantic and syntactic information. The next step chains multiple questions on the same event to predict a timeline, which is then used to ground the answers. Results on the TORQUE and TB-dense, TRC and TRE tasks respectively, demonstrate that TRN outperforms previous methods by effectively resolving the spurious overlaps using the predicted timeline."}

Previous methods focused on either graph structure learning or semantic reasoning, failing to integrate dual reasoning perspectives to handle different prediction scenarios. Moreover, they lack the capability to capture the inherent differences between historical and non-historical events, which limits their generalization across different temporal contexts. To this end, we propose a Multi-Expert Structural-Semantic Hybrid (MESH) framework that employs three kinds of expert modules to integrate both structural and semantic information, guiding the reasoning process for different events. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel task called timely dialogue response generation and introduce the TimelyChat benchmark, which evaluates the capabilities of language models to predict appropriate time intervals and generate time-conditioned responses. Additionally, we construct a large-scale training dataset by leveraging unlabeled event knowledge from a temporal commonsense knowledge graph and employing a large language model (LLM) to synthesize 55K event-driven dialogues. We then train Timer, a dialogue agent designed to proactively predict time intervals and generate timely responses that align with those intervals. Experimental results show that Timer outperforms prompting-based LLMs and other fine-tuned baselines in both turn-level and dialogue-level evaluations. We publicly release our data, model, and code."}

Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelgänger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack. We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)'' prompt to counter the Doppelgänger method. The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelgänger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information. In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack."}
