A\nprimary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads\nto profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions\nacross different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to\nrediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation,\nartificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced\nmultibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a\nData-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form\nNewton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for\ntensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition\nof the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an\nuncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port\nvariable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling,\ncontrol, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the\nstructurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface,\nproven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are\nvalidated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for\ndata-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant\nlearning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction.

This paper\npresents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without\nprior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement\nunit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent\nefficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode.

Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding\nin large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'\nacceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's\ncore innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,\npredicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully\ncomputed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free\nverification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,\nenabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while\nincurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces\nsample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources\nbased on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler\nsamples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.\nExperiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality\ndegradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation\nfidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The\nverification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference\ncosts), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference\nwhile maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.\nOur codes have been released in Github:\n\\textbf{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion}"}

Recent research\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide\nresponse-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle\nto identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as\nthose arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user\nbehavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for\ndetecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft\nClustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based\napproach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by\namplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based\nSample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation\nlearning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 --\nacross multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for\ndetecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong\ngeneralization to unknown intent detection."}

However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,\nphysicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of\ntrials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote\nresearch, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.\n  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based\ndifferential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,\nbut image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and\nCaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI."}

We present Structured Masking for AR-based\nLayout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that\neffectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image\ngeneration. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed\nstructured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the\ninteraction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design\nprevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while\nenabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation\nprocess. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we\nincorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training\nscheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR\nmodels. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly\nintegrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising\ngeneration quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining\nthe structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models."}

Environments are not passive testing\ngrounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit\nvery challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous\ncapacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets\nhas led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the\nstructure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these\nenvironments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents."}
