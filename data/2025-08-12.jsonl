This paper\nintroduces AquaChat++, a novel multi-ROV inspection framework that uses Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive mission planning, coordinated task\nexecution, and fault-tolerant control in complex aquaculture environments. The\nproposed system consists of a two-layered architecture.

A task\nmanager dynamically allocates and schedules actions among ROVs based on their\nreal-time status and operational constraints, including thruster faults and\nbattery levels. The low-level control layer ensures accurate trajectory\ntracking and integrates thruster fault detection and compensation mechanisms.\nBy incorporating real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning, AquaChat++\nenhances system robustness and operational efficiency.

However, leading\ncompanies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex\ndesigns such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in\ncomplex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access\nvia paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are\neasily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning\ncapabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework\nnamed Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the\nsmall VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the\nlarge model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate\nresponses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a\ntest-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the\nsmall VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the\nlarge VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both\nopen-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world\npersonalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various\nbenchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC\nframework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC."}

We argue that an effective defense\nnot only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,\nwhich occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images.

However, existing methods compromise text quality,\nrequire white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations\nexclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a\ngeneral framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized\nmessages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without\naltering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on\ndeterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose\nfeature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally\ngeneralizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through\nsampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees\nrelating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any\nsuitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection\naccuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's\nconsistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection\naccuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that\nworks out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content\nattribution."}

This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video\ndiffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos\nwithout post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,\nStableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable\ninfinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing\nexisting models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They\ntypically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio\nembeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via\ncross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related\npriors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation\nacross video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to\ndrift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,\nStableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents\nerror accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose\na novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio\nsynchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent\nprediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the\ninfinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy\nthat fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness\nof StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on\nmanual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant\noperational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the\nend-to-end \"AI weather station\" is gradually emerging as a new trend in\npredicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development\nof end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event\nsamples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data\nand textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to\nhandle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the\ncomplex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and\nspatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the\nfirst large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events\nprediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and\ncorresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios\nacross China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large\nmodel (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is\ndesigned to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data\nflow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable\ndynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical\npressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench\ndemonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a\nkey step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our\nsource code and dataset will be made publicly available."}
