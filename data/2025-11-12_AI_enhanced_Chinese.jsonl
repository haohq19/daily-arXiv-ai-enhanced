Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d2\u503c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6216\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9632\u6b62\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u9a8c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\uff08\u9510\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d2\u503c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eHutchinson\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57281D\u30012D\u73a9\u5177\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b", "conclusion": "\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4e0e\u5f97\u5206\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d2\u503c\u5e7b\u89c9"}}

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc77\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u7740\u4f30\u503c\u8fa9\u62a4\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u7ea7LLM\u548c3\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u5bfc\u5411\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b7\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57284\u9636\u6bb5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u504f\u89c1\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u6297\u6311\u6218\u3001\u4f19\u4f34\u72b6\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f19\u4f34\u72b6\u6001\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u5174\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5f53\u67b6\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8017\u5c3d\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u89e3\u6563\u7eaa\u5f8b\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u6d6a\u8d39\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u67b6\u6784\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u9632\u6b62\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u8ba4\u77e5\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u671f\u671b\u3002"}}

The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets.

We simulate these gaps with an open-ended narrative cloze task: asking LLMs to generate a masked event in a character-centric timeline sourced from a novel corpus of unpublished texts. We evaluate audited (for data contamination), fully-open models (the OLMo-2 family) and unaudited open-weight and proprietary baselines under a range of prompts designed to elicit controlled and useful hallucinations.

A Case Study", "comment": "2 Tables; ML/Big data paper on medical data", "summary": "The integration of advanced analytical tools, including Machine Learning (ML) and massive data processing, has revolutionized health research, promising unprecedented accuracy in diagnosis and risk prediction. However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable.

Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format.

Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:027", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. This study underscores the necessity for comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Each body part is controlled by a phase variable capable of forward and backward evolution, with a phase coverage reward to promote the exploration of the leg phase space. Additionally, morphological symmetry of the robot is incorporated via data augmentation, improving sample efficiency and enforcing both motion-level and task-level symmetry in learned behaviors.

Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4ece\u63a2\u7d22\u5230\u5229\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728GRPO\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u9650\u5236GRPO\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u6837\u5316\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5de9\u56fa\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cdMLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff08Qwen2-VL-2B\u3001Qwen2-VL-7B\u3001Qwen2.5-VL-3B\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5916\u90e8\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728MLLM\u7684RLVR\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5bb9\u5fcd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHamilton-Jacobi\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u79f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1", "conclusion": "\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c"}}

Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions.

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u514b\u670d\u5404\u81ea\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u7ba1\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on large-scale benchmarks. An SNN trained on the generated I2E-ImageNet dataset achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.50%. Critically, this work establishes a powerful sim-to-real paradigm where pre-training on synthetic I2E data and fine-tuning on the real-world CIFAR10-DVS dataset yields an unprecedented accuracy of 92.5%. This result validates that synthetic event data can serve as a high-fidelity proxy for real sensor data, bridging a long-standing gap in neuromorphic engineering. By providing a scalable solution to the data problem, I2E offers a foundational toolkit for developing high-performance neuromorphic systems. The open-source algorithm and all generated datasets are provided to accelerate research in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "I2E\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5fae\u626b\u89c6\u773c\u52a8\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86300\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ImageNet\u548cCIFAR10-DVS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(SNN)\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e25\u91cd\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u62df\u5fae\u626b\u89c6\u773c\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728I2E-ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SNN\u8fbe\u523060.50%\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728CIFAR10-DVS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9792.5%\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded.

Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging.

Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LPPG-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u89e3\u51b3\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168RL\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u51b2\u7a81\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u6295\u5f71\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Dykstra\u6295\u5f71\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22\u9632\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u5bfc\u822a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eLPPG-RL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LPPG-RL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop.
