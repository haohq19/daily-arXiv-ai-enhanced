This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration.

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning."}

A key challenge is to\nmodel patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both\nindividual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our\napproach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation\nlearning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings\nto capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with\nexisting deep learning based survival pipelines.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning."}

Even\nadvanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in\nthese conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution\nclouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate\nreward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.\nThis paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying\nclassical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and\nnonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of\nmodifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,\nand the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to\nprevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte\nCarlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two\nexhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to\ncomplex environments.
