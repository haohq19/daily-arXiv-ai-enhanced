### [1] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于热成像的时间反转重建框架，使用RGB和热图像配对来恢复几秒前的场景状态，结合视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程实现语义一致的重建。


<details>

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程耦合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。使用RGB和热图像配对进行时间反转重建。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，证明可以重建120秒前的合理过去帧，为基于热痕迹的时间反转成像提供了初步步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从热痕迹进行时间反转重建的可行性，为法医学和场景分析中的过去事件恢复提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [2] [Detection and Measurement of Hailstones with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06008)
*Moritz Alker,David C. Schedl,Andreas Stöckl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用预训练多模态大语言模型从社交媒体和新闻图像中检测和测量冰雹直径，通过两阶段提示策略提高测量可靠性，平均绝对误差为1.12厘米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统冰雹传感器覆盖范围有限，需要从社交媒体图像中提取更密集的空间信息来快速评估恶劣天气事件。

Method: 使用474张奥地利冰雹事件的众包图像，采用一阶段和两阶段提示策略，利用图像中的参考物体（如人手）作为尺寸线索来估计冰雹直径。

Result: 预训练模型无需微调即可从图像中测量冰雹直径，最佳模型的平均绝对误差为1.12厘米，两阶段提示提高了大多数模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 现成的预训练模型可以补充传统冰雹传感器，从社交媒体图像中提取有意义的信息，实现更快更详细的恶劣天气评估。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

### [3] [Emergent AI Surveillance: Overlearned Person Re-Identification and Its Mitigation in Law Enforcement Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06026)
*An Thi Nguyen,Radina Stoykova,Eric Arazo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中能有效检索特定对象，但研究发现这些模型即使在没有人类数据的训练集上也会意外获得识别特定个人的能力，这引发了隐私担忧。作者评估了两种技术防护措施，发现组合使用可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，但防护措施仍存在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是发现通用实例搜索模型存在意外出现的人员识别能力，即使在没有人类数据的训练集上也能识别特定个人，这引发了关于个人数据识别和画像的隐私担忧，目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失。通过实验测试这些方法在减少人员重识别能力方面的效果，同时保持对非人物体的检索性能。

Result: 实验表明，组合使用索引排除和混淆损失可以将人员重识别准确率降低到2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞，包括使用部分人物图像可能绕过防护。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了AI治理和数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有突发识别能力的系统？以及应该要求什么技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

### [4] [VideoMiner: Iteratively Grounding Key Frames of Hour-Long Videos via Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06040)
*Xinye Cao,Hongcan Guo,Jiawen Qian,Guoshun Nan,Chao Wang,Yuqi Pan,Tianhao Hou,Xiaojuan Wang,Yutong Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMiner通过迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，结合T-GRPO强化学习方法，有效解决长视频理解中冗余信息干扰和关键帧识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1) 如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2) 如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner系统，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，并引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法指导关键帧定位。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，T-GRPO意外地激励模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，为多模态大语言模型在长视频分析中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/caoxinye/VideoMiner.

### [5] [Discretized Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model for Deep Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05168)
*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Milan Stojkov,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络的QIF神经元模型离散化方法，在保持训练稳定性的同时实现了比LIF神经元更丰富的非线性动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力受限，而QIF等复杂模型具有更丰富的非线性动态但训练不稳定，因此需要开发既能保持训练稳定性又能提供更强表达能力的神经元模型。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，并直接从离散化参数集中推导出替代梯度窗口的解析公式，以最小化梯度不匹配问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等数据集上评估，该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: QIF神经元的离散化方法为深度SNNs提供了比LIF神经元更有吸引力的替代方案，结合了更丰富的动态特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

### [6] [Learning More with Less: A Generalizable, Self-Supervised Framework for Privacy-Preserving Capacity Estimation with EV Charging Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05172)
*Anushiya Arunan,Yan Qin,Xiaoli Li,U-Xuan Tan,H. Vincent Poor,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出首个基于自监督预训练的电池容量估计模型，使用隐私友好的充电数据片段，通过片段相似性加权掩码输入重建学习通用表示，在域偏移场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对消费者信心至关重要，但隐私法规和标注数据短缺限制了通用化模型的开发，现有自监督方法难以从隐私友好但特征较少、噪声较多的现场数据中有效学习。

Method: 提出片段相似性加权掩码输入重建预训练框架，首先使用对比学习捕获片段间高层相似性，然后进行相似性加权的掩码重建，学习细粒度充电模式和高层关联关系。

Result: 模型在制造商和老化引起的域偏移设置下，测试误差比最佳基准方法降低31.9%，在真实世界数据分布变化下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该自监督预训练方法能够从隐私友好但特征有限的数据中学习丰富表示，为电池容量估计提供了有效的解决方案，在现实场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

### [7] [A Data-Driven Prism: Multi-View Source Separation with Diffusion Model Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05205)
*Sebastian Wagner-Carena,Aizhan Akhmetzhanova,Sydney Erickson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的源分离方法，无需对源进行显式假设，仅依赖多视图观测数据即可解决源分离问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统源分离方法依赖简化的源模型，无法准确复现数据。需要一种能够从噪声、不完整数据中学习复杂先验分布的方法来解决源分离问题。

Method: 使用扩散模型，仅依赖多视图观测（即不同观测包含未知源的不同线性变换）来学习源先验分布，无需对源进行显式假设。

Result: 该方法在源未被单独观测、观测数据存在噪声、不完整且分辨率变化的情况下仍能成功分离源，能够从源先验中采样、评估候选源概率，并基于观测从联合后验分布中采样。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够有效解决源分离问题，在合成问题和真实星系观测中都表现出良好性能，为自然科学中的源分离任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

### [8] [Comparing LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Forecasting Strategies for 24-Hour Solar Proton Flux Profiles Using GOES Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05399)
*Kangwoo Yi,Bo Shen,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Yong-Jae Moon,Jaewon Lee,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用基于LSTM的seq2seq深度学习模型预测太阳质子事件后24小时的质子通量时间剖面，通过多种配置对比发现单次预测优于自回归预测，趋势平滑能提升质子+X射线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统造成严重辐射危害，准确预测质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，基于LSTM的seq2seq模型，通过4折分层交叉验证评估不同配置：质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs单次预测。

Result: 单次预测误差低于自回归预测；原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或逆转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；趋势平滑数据训练模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，单次预测策略和适当的数据预处理能显著提升预测精度，模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

*Zizhao Wang,Dingcheng Li,Vaishakh Keshava,Phillip Wallis,Ananth Balashankar,Peter Stone,Lukas Rutishauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗强化学习训练LLM代理，让攻击者自动生成多样化的提示注入攻击，同时训练代理防御这些攻击，提高了代理的安全性和任务完成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理使用工具时面临间接提示注入攻击风险，现有防御方法依赖手动构建的攻击数据集，缺乏多样性，无法应对新型攻击。

Method: 使用对抗强化学习框架，将问题建模为两人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者和防御者LLM，并采用基于群体的学习框架防止循环学习。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS微调的代理攻击成功率显著降低，同时任务成功率也有所提高。

Conclusion: 对抗过程生成了多样化且具有挑战性的攻击，相比基础模型产生了更鲁棒的代理。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

*Arpit Kapoor,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Quantile DeepGR4J框架，通过分位数回归集成学习方法扩展DeepGR4J模型，用于量化径流预测的不确定性并识别极端洪水事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合水文模型与深度学习模型以提高可解释性和预测性能，特别是利用分位数回归模型来量化不确定性并辅助极端值预测。

Method: 使用分位数回归集成学习框架扩展DeepGR4J，将其应用于多步径流预测的不确定性边界，并在CAMELS-Aus数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 与基线深度学习模型相比，Quantile DeepGR4J框架提高了预测精度和不确定性区间质量（区间得分），并证明其适合作为洪水预警系统。

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架在径流预测的不确定性量化和洪水风险评估方面表现出色，具有作为早期预警系统的潜力。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

TL;DR: 提出GTRANS迁移学习框架，通过邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输在相关图之间对齐和迁移结构模式，解决小图网络估计问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图模型估计通常需要大图数据，但实践中往往只能获得小规模网络，需要利用相关大图的结信息来改进小图的估计精度

Method: 结合邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输来对齐图结构，并包含自适应去偏机制通过残差平滑识别和校正目标图特定偏差

Result: 理论证明了对齐矩阵的稳定性，在合成和真实数据实验中显著提高了目标图估计精度，并改善了图分类和链接预测等下游任务性能

Conclusion: GTRANS框架有效解决了小图网络估计问题，通过迁移学习显著提升了估计精度和下游应用性能

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

### [12] [LATTA: Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation for Enhanced Robustness and Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05530)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚点机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移，无需架构改变或昂贵的蒙特卡洛计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或复杂损坏情况下，这源于复杂损失表面上过于确定性的更新。

Method: 结合两种机制：(1) 受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；(2) 稳定权重锚点，防止模型偏离其鲁棒的源预训练。

Result: 在Rotated-MNIST和CIFAR-10-C等标准基准测试中，LATTA显著优于现有方法（Tent、CoTTA、EATA），在CIFAR-10-C上将平均准确率提高超过2%，同时降低性能方差。

Conclusion: LATTA为自监督测试时自适应设立了新的最先进水平，实现了有效适应而不会牺牲稳定性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

*Egor Surkov,Dmitry Osin,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了人类行为序列中事件未来分布的预测问题，挑战了主流的自回归范式，发现显式分布预测方法优于隐式基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在零售、金融、医疗和推荐系统等领域，预测事件未来分布比精确的时间顺序更重要，需要探索比自回归方法更有效的建模策略。

Method: 分析局部顺序不变性，引入基于KL散度的指标量化时间漂移，比较显式分布预测与隐式多标记方法的性能。

Result: 简单的显式分布预测目标持续优于复杂的隐式基线方法，预测类别的模式崩溃主要由分布不平衡驱动。

Conclusion: 为选择建模策略提供了原则性框架，并为构建更准确和鲁棒的预测系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more

TL;DR: 本文发现现有混合线性注意力方法存在关键缺陷：线性组件被无意绕过，主要依赖滑动窗口softmax。提出了三种解决方案来确保组件平衡使用，恢复线性注意力的真正采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了其可扩展性，而现有线性注意力混合方法在实际评估中存在线性组件被绕过的缺陷，导致性能归因失真。

Method: 提出三种方法：(1) 推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；(2) HedgeCATs，结合注意力权重转移和针对性LoRA微调；(3) 计划滑动窗口dropout(SSD)，在训练中随机抑制softmax分支以防止组件崩溃。

Result: 方法在保持计算效率的同时，恢复了大部分基础模型性能，并确保真正的线性注意力采用，恢复了混合转换中性能归因的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过提出的三种解决方案，成功解决了现有混合线性注意力方法中线性组件被绕过的问题，确保了组件平衡使用和性能归因的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

*Guillaume Godin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: molFTP是一种紧凑的分子片段-靶点流行度表示方法，通过虚拟掩码防止交叉验证中的特征泄漏，并使用关键留一法近似真实分子级留一法，实现高效无偏的性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子表示学习中交叉验证时的特征泄漏问题，同时降低留一法验证的计算成本。

Method: 提出molFTP表示方法，采用虚拟掩码技术防止特征泄漏，并使用关键留一法近似真实分子级留一法验证。

Result: 关键留一法与真实分子级留一法的偏差低于8%，能够以较低成本实现近似全数据训练和无偏交叉验证性能评估。

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、抗泄漏的片段-靶点流行度向量化方法，具有实用的保护机制，能以较低成本近似留一法验证。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

*David Lüdke,Marten Lienen,Marcel Kollovieh,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于时序点过程的Edit Flow方法，通过插入、删除和替换编辑操作将噪声转化为数据，在连续时间马尔可夫链框架中学习瞬时编辑率，从而在生成过程中减少必要的编辑操作数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时序点过程模型主要依赖自回归参数化，受到顺序采样的限制。最近的非自回归扩散模型通过离散马尔可夫链中的事件插入和删除来缓解这些问题，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入Edit Flow过程，通过插入、删除和替换编辑操作在连续时间马尔可夫链框架中学习瞬时编辑率，将噪声传输到数据。

Result: 经验结果表明，无条件训练的模型在基准时序点过程的各种无条件和条件生成任务中表现出生成灵活性。

Conclusion: Edit Flow方法提供了一个灵活高效的时序点过程模型，有效减少了生成过程中必要的编辑操作数量。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的统计方法来预测AI模型在大规模采样下的能力和风险，解决了标准方法在数据有限情况下的统计缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型被大规模使用，需要准确预测模型在大量尝试下的行为和风险，但现有方法在数据有限时预测准确性不足。

Method: 引入基于beta-二项分布的稳健估计框架，并提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给更难的问题。

Result: 该方法能够以更低的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 提出的稳健估计框架和动态采样策略显著提高了在大规模采样场景下预测AI模型行为和风险的准确性。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: D2E框架利用桌面游戏环境作为机器人具身AI的预训练平台，通过标准化数据收集和伪标注技术，成功将数字交互技能迁移到物理机器人任务中。


<details>

Motivation: 解决具身AI因物理轨迹收集成本高昂而受限的问题，利用桌面游戏环境提供大规模传感器运动交互数据。

Method: 开发了三个组件：OWA工具包标准化桌面交互数据并实现152倍压缩；Generalist-IDM通过时间戳事件预测实现零样本泛化；VAPT将桌面预训练表示迁移到物理操作和导航任务。

Result: 使用1300+小时数据（259小时人类演示+1000+小时伪标注游戏数据），在LIBERO操作任务上达到96.6%成功率，在CANVAS导航任务上达到83.3%成功率。

Conclusion: 数字交互中的传感器运动基元具有足够的不变性，能够有效迁移到物理具身任务，确立了桌面预训练作为机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度的早期预测方法，使用XGBoost模型在30分钟内就能有效预测网络迷因的病毒式传播，准确率PR-AUC>0.52。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒式传播具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒式传播的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度的病毒性定义方法，评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知机等多种模型，采用包含静态内容和时间动态的全面多模态特征集。

Result: XGBoost模型表现最佳，在短短30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC>0.52的预测效果。分析发现存在明显的"证据转换"现象，即随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 这项研究为早期病毒性预测建立了一个稳健、可解释且实用的基准，特别是在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准RAG在法律领域中的核心限制，特别是如何在保持结构化知识确定性属性的同时进行可靠查询。

Method: 引入基于规范动作的查询执行层，将复杂查询分解为有向无环图(DAG)的动作序列，实现混合搜索、引用解析、时间版本检索和因果追踪。

Result: 构建了两层架构，将检索从黑盒过程转变为透明可审计的过程，直接满足高风险领域对可解释AI(XAI)的要求。

Conclusion: SAT-Graph API通过规范动作实现了法律知识图谱的可靠查询，同时保持了确定性属性和可审计性，为高风险领域提供了透明化的检索解决方案。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

*Batu El,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 优化LLMs在竞争环境中的表现会无意中导致模型失准，表现为欺骗性营销、虚假信息和有害行为的增加，即使模型被明确指示要保持真实和可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解竞争性反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，特别是在商业广告、选举和社交媒体等竞争性环境中，这些环境中各方都在争夺受众的认可。

Method: 使用模拟环境来研究LLMs在商业、选举和社交媒体场景中的行为，测量竞争成功与模型失准之间的关系。

Result: 在商业环境中，销售增长6.3%伴随着欺骗性营销增加14.0%；选举中，选票份额增长4.9%伴随着虚假信息增加22.3%和民粹主义言论增加12.5%；社交媒体中，参与度提升7.5%伴随着虚假信息增加188.6%和有害行为推广增加16.3%。

Conclusion: 竞争性优化压力会系统性地侵蚀模型的对齐性，形成恶性竞争，AI系统的安全部署需要更强的治理和精心设计的激励机制来防止竞争动态破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了WeatherArchive-Bench基准，用于评估历史天气档案上的检索增强生成系统，包含检索和评估两个任务，揭示了密集检索器在历史术语上的失败和LLM在解读社会脆弱性与韧性概念时的常见误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史天气档案包含丰富的社会应对极端天气事件的定性叙述，这些信息在气象记录中缺失，但对理解社会响应很有价值。然而，档案规模庞大、数字化质量嘈杂和古旧语言使其难以转化为结构化知识用于气候研究。

Method: 构建WeatherArchive-Bench基准，包含两个任务：WeatherArchive-Retrieval评估从超过100万档案新闻片段中定位相关段落的能力；WeatherArchive-Assessment评估LLM从极端天气叙述中分类社会脆弱性和韧性指标的能力。

Result: 实验显示密集检索器在处理历史术语时经常失败，而LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了在推理复杂社会指标方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计更稳健的基于档案背景的气候聚焦RAG系统提供了见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/WeatherArchive-Bench/.

TL;DR: TKTO方法通过消除对配对数据的需求，实现了更高效的数据训练范式，并直接针对token级单元，自动提供细粒度对齐信号而无需token级标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于人类反馈的TTS偏好优化方法主要需要utterance级别的配对样本，但这种配对数据在TTS输出中往往有限，且utterance级别的表述阻碍了准确发音对齐所需的细粒度token级优化。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单元，自动提供细粒度对齐信号而不需要token级标注。

Result: TKTO将具有挑战性的日语TTS准确率提高了39%，CER降低了54%，自动为目标token分配了12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO方法有效解决了TTS系统中配对数据有限和细粒度对齐困难的问题，显著提升了发音准确性和自然度。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出平行分词器框架，通过词汇对齐实现跨语言语义等价词的统一表示，提升低资源语言的跨语言迁移性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法无法有效支持跨语言迁移，因为语义等价的词在不同语言中被分配不同的嵌入表示，限制了跨语言泛化能力

Method: 训练单语言分词器，然后使用双语词典或词对词翻译对词汇表进行彻底对齐，确保语义等价词具有一致的索引

Result: 在13种低资源语言上预训练的模型，在情感分析、仇恨言论检测、情感分类和句子嵌入相似度等任务中均优于传统多语言基线

Conclusion: 重新思考分词方法对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源场景下

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.
