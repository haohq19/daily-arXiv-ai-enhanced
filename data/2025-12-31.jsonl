On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning.

While this \"extrinsic maximization\" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation."}

Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment.

While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies."}

This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms.

However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets."}

Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping.

However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%.

Code available at https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel", "summary": "Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets."}

In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction.

Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods.

However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system.

While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies."}

Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.
