Recent methods frequently leverage pretrained networks to calculate perceptual losses or utilize pretrained feature spaces. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of pretrained networks by incorporating innovative self-supervised learning techniques and enforcing consistency between discriminators during GAN training. Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency.

Based on this insight, we propose a pre-deployment test that uses a small pilot of 50 tasks to estimate whether intervention is likely to help or harm, without requiring full deployment. Across benchmarks, the test correctly anticipates outcomes: intervention degrades performance on high-success tasks (0 to -26 pp), while yielding a modest improvement on the high-failure ALFWorld benchmark (+2.8 pp, p=0.014). The primary value of our framework is therefore identifying when not to intervene, preventing severe regressions before deployment."}

This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process."}

The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists.

A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes."}

We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa."}

Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning.

This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity."}

In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths."}

To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity."}

The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists.

More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals.

MARA operates directly on the angular and radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, enabling flexible, geometrically informed, and modular weighting of local environments.

A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes."}

In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints.

Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection."}

However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

In this paper, we introduce Rank-Learner, a novel two-stage learner that directly learns the ranking of treatment effects from observational data. We first show that naive approaches based on precise treatment effect estimation solve a harder problem than necessary for ranking, while our Rank-Learner optimizes a pairwise learning objective that recovers the true treatment effect ordering, without explicit CATE estimation. We further show that our Rank-Learner is Neyman-orthogonal and thus comes with strong theoretical guarantees, including robustness to estimation errors in the nuisance functions. In addition, our Rank-Learner is model-agnostic, and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments where Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods.

However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical."}

Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling.

This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process."}
