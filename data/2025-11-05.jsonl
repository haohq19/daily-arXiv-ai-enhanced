Using 2,368\neconomics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to\nreplicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds\n(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human\nexperts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,\nunemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against\n100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We\nreport two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve\nremarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically\nsignificant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025\ndata demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance\non unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample\nperiod. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting\nadvantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be\nomitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results\nprovide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even\non out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,\nwhile revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts\ncompared to human panels."}

This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism\nfor tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a\nwide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on\nadditional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages\nthe event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional\nNeural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial\nspace and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The\nefficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector\nframework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across\nvarious frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:\nenhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased\npercentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,\nwhich serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,\ndecreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in\nlow-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach\nto significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of\nadverse lighting scenarios."}

A clipping function\nis introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio\nin these \"right\" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to\nextend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering\nthe clipping in the \"right\" direction regions. However, due to randomness in\nthe rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the\nratios frequently move to the \"wrong\" direction during the PPO optimization.\nThis is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely\noverlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm\n(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict \"wrong\"\ndirection regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance\nratio falls below (above) $1 - \\beta$ ($1+\\beta$),\n  for a tunable parameter $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a\nsteeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that\nDClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing\non modifying the objective's behavior in the \"right\" direction, across various\nMuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is\nshown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid \"wrong\" direction\nupdates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1."}
