While demonstrations exist across environmental and social\ndomains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability\nremains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of\nLLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a\nfield where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.\n  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial\nand open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced\npractitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA\npractice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,\nverifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.\n  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading\ninformation. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally\nrated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence\nwas generally rated favourably.

There was\nno clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight\nLLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with\nclosed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.\n  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\\\"ively in\nLCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing\nbenefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour\nintensiveness of simple tasks.

This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based\nAsynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled\nby events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce\nreconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that\nregulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving\ncamera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image\ngradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to\nmost existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an\narbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million\nevents/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative\nexperiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction\nbetween FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet).

However, existing approaches typically\nrely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level\ncross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse\nmolecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement\nframework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph\nthat integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of\ninter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is\nthe potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling\nlong-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure\nconsistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the\nglobal structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively\nlearn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.\npatterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI\ntypes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge\nconsistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph\nrefinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic\ninterpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining\nand Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing\ndrug-drug interaction networks."}

This imbalance\nleads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn\ndegrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies\nthis issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This\nstudy proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.\nFollowing a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is\ndecomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of\nnon-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of\nlight-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to\nhandle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by\ntransforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.\nComprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating\nrainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over\nconventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its\nkey advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and\na marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a\ngeneralizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of\nenvironmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact\nevents."}

We conducted a\nretrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins\nHealth System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208\nadmissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included\nas low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain\ninterpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on\nJHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.\nThe model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over\nthe current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained\nscore optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR\nvariables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the\nperformance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression\n(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk\nlabelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health\nsystems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and\npatient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to\nimproved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings."}

In survival analysis,\ncensoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model\ndevelopment. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook\ndisparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be\nranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of\nmortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine\nequitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed\nto mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk\nrankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and\napplying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially\nimproves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to\nfairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM\nmaintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest\nimprovements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables\nthe development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in\nclinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical\ncare."}
