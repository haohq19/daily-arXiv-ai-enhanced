The approach integrates object-centric process\nmining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a\nstochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered\nfrom grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply\nactivities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the\nquantity of products in the store evolves over time.

We offer three orthogonal improvements to\nimprove PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we\npropose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the\nevent onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.\nSecond, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them\npatient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the\nlargest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the\np-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as\nperson identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization.

We identify a\ncritical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation\ncascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature\nconvergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,\nlow-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,\nwhere conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting\nchaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle\nthrough three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in\nmulti-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing\nregularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent\nabrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances\nexploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO\nguarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining\nconvergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld\nand up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn\nsparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than\ntraditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training."}

Existing token\nsparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token\nrepresentations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them\nineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose\nProgressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for\nevent data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the\nspatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to\neffectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an\noptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists\nof two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial\nToken Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the\nspatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent\ninterference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token\nSelection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event\nframes, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We\napply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,\nand ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets.

This novel strategy randomly selects\nbetween several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large\nlanguage model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a\nBernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated\nwith RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the\ngradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:\n  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model\nwith RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.\nThis reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in\nthe CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from\nscratch with the RELU activation function.\n  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs\nreasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic\nnon-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an\nalternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase\nthe diversity of the generated text."}

We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in\nvalue-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes\nnegative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile\nAdvantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile\nbaseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=\n1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it\ntargets remaining failures.

In this work, we investigate\nRL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,\nfocusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical\nanalyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce\nco-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning\nprimarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling\nbetter generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity\ncollapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even\nafter perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key\nadvantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We\nfurther demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward\nhacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world\nplanning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in\npractice."}
