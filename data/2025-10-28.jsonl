This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use.

One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact\n  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject\n  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we\n  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method\n  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced\nLinear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of\n  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former\nbased MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms\n  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the\n  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks."}

We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal\ninteractions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and\ninteraction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of\nineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions\nfor a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.\nExisting methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning\nprocess, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,\nespecially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.\nTo cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which\ncontains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and\nlink history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information\nthrough transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA\nprevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being\nforgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly\nand readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment\nresults on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)\ndatasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance\nof the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings.
