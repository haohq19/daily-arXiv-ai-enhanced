In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly\nextends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and\nNemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1\npercentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of\n14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data.

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment\nframeworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for\nreducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes\nin AI systems and the societies they influence."}

In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged\nas a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,\nthe factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly\nextends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and\nNemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1\npercentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of\n14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly\noptimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and\npractical expertise.

This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM\ncapability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of\ndomains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing\ndisparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of\nexisting approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely\non traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on\nfinal-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs\nunder the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable\ncommercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we\npropose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via\nprompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited\nfrom its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using\nprompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain\nsufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied\nto these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.\nExperiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong\naccuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from\nboth open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is\ndata-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings\n(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features."}

Many existing methods treat posts independently\nand fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time\nand modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for\nrobustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into\npseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then\nprocesses each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual\nfeatures are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via\nintra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal\nattention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event\nlevel, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To\naddress class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates\nadaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example\nmining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments\non Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations\nfurther demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical\napplicability across diverse misinformation scenarios."}

However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying\nevent order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core\nchallenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism\nfor encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or\nmodifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of\ntemporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this\nbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal\ninformation is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information\npathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame\nattention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the\nquery tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges\nfrom inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,\nwhich implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we\npropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a\ntemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal\nunderstanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement."}
