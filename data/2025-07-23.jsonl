In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these\nchallenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing\nindependent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,\nbecause gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,\nperformance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from\nsupplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and\nfacilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary\nNetwork++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by\nemploying the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent\nblocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,\nupdated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.\nNotably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal\ndue to feature discrepancies between local blocks.
