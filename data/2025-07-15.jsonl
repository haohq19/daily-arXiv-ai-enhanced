This ability makes SNNs\nwell-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)\nwhere battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,\nthis paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and\nobstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a\nLIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together\nwith the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.\nCrucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first\nfocused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN\nprecision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that\nby carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking\nLeaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to\nachieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during\nthis work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future\nresearch."}

Emotional\nexpression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human\npsychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial\nhidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and\ninterviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression\nanalysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion\nuniversality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and\nsocial contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of\nethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the\nemotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective\nof manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate\nthe level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.\nWe construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically\nannotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically\nannotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and\nstereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain\ninfluence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we\npropose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature\nlearning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises\nethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition.

However,\nmost text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to\nexploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the\nall-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the\nspectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),\na novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR\nimages into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves\na new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.\nAdditionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent\ndifficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge\nfrom the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which\nintegrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful\ntrade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general\nsemantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving\nlocation-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features.
