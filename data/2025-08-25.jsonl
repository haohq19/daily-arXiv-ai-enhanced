Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.\nFirstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a\nCross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically\nquery and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams\nwithin the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a\nhierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,\nand interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional\nparameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our\nproposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute\nError (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%.

This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR\n(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a\nnovel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a\nVideo-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into\ncompact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent \"visual event sequences\"\nthrough lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal\npooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nfoundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support\nclinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR\ndata into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We\nintroduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that\nnatively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and\nfuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a\nLLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,\nwhere it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while\nalso performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction\n(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for\nclinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day\nreadmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on\nMIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and\n30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627.

With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities.

Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.\nFirstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a\nCross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically\nquery and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams\nwithin the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a\nhierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,\nand interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional\nparameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our\nproposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute\nError (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves\nthese results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior\nbalance between performance and computational efficiency."}

Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient\noutcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nfoundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support\nclinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR\ndata into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We\nintroduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that\nnatively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and\nfuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a\nLLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,\nwhere it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while\nalso performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction\n(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for\nclinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day\nreadmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on\nMIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and\n30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved\nROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,\nGDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical\nutility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing\naccuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can\nboth predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical\nnarratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to\nadditional modalities."}

The\nproposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level\nnavigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task\nperformance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion\ncommands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to\nprevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation\nmethods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating\nerratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world\nvalidations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and\neffectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a\nscalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,\nreal-world scenarios."}
