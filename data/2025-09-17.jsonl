It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

However, the limited\navailability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges\nfor effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer\nsemantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the\nsignificant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we\npropose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing\nstrategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and\nDVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal\nscenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.\nThese objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's\nability to discriminate effectively across different modalities.

In\nthis paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with\nultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To\nmitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking\nConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate\nan amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to\nbridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\ncounterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to\neffectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also\nintegrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the\ntemporal dimension with negligible computational overhead.

A key challenge in training SNNs is to\nsolve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for\ntraining SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.\nHowever, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality\nobserved in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and\nmemory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.\nAlthough existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment\nby leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit\nassignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase\nmemory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this\nwork, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,\nscalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a\nlayer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP\noutperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On\nmore complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases\ncompetitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such\nas VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully\nlocal scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.\nFinally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such\nas keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way\nfor efficient learning at the edge."}

Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic\nforgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,\nclass-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.\nIn this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL\nbased on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix\n(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its\nvariants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal\napproximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To\novercome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature\napproximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our\nmethod directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without\nexplicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself.

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}
