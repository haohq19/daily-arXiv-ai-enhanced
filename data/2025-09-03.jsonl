When it happens, deploying\nemergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human\nresponders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and\ndisaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete\nperception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To\nenhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire\nscenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire\nprevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency\nresponse documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph\n(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large\nMultimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs\nfrom real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide\ninterpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component\nconfiguration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and\nreal-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical\napplication value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making."}

Therefore, Task and Motion\nPlanning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or\neven in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete\naction sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In\nthis paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,\nreferred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different\nscenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,\nwhich expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop\nmotion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,\nTMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a\ncertain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate\nfor unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled\nautonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)\nbounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of\nunfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative\npaths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We\nuse a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous\nrobots.

However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid\noverfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even\ncollapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce\ntheir own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.\nTo this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called\nCurriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL).

However, this joint\nlearning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities\noverwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from\neach modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing\nstrategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient\nmodulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods\nremain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it\narises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This\nlimitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance\nlearning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective\ninteractions between modalities and better utilization of information from\nindividual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce\nUnidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the\nconventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.\nUDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned\nrepresentations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,\nthe dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to\nthe task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By\ndecoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI\nprevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal\nfeature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms\nexisting methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance\nimprovement in multimodal learning tasks."}

However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in\nthe effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the\ncorresponding sampling strategy.

Toward effective incorporation of\nthe confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We\nfirst establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity\nand coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained\nminimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be\nequivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,\nwhich is NP-hard.
