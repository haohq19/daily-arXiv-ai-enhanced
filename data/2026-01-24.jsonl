The system clusters behavior windows into behavioral archetypes and uses binary confidence gating to activate archetype-based scoring only when confidence exceeds a threshold, falling back to baseline predictions when uncertain. We validate Lattice on recommendation systems (MovieLens), scientific time-series (LIGO), and financial markets, using LSTM and transformer backbones. On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation. On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present. This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications."}

Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events."}

We introduce \\textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment."}

To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment."}

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape."}
