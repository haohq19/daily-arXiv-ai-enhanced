Accepted by RA-L", "summary": "A cooperative circumnavigation framework is proposed for multi-quadrotor\nsystems to enclose and track a moving target without reliance on external\nlocalization systems. The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor\nand quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous\nperception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified\nKalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range\nmeasurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.\nAn event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust\ntarget state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor\nmeasurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the\nestimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,\nleveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct\nextensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the\nproposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments. Furthermore, a\nquadrotor failure experiment highlights the inherent fault tolerance property\nof the proposed framework, underscoring its potential for deployment in\nsearch-and-rescue operations."}

However, inherent photometric distortions\nin the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without\naccounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently\nincorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the\nquality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D\nscene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By\nintroducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full\nphotometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on\nsimultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the\nproposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D\nscene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric\nparameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene\nrepresentation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the\ncamera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a\ncomplete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera\nphotometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of\nimaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt."}

The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail\nto replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from\nthe unlearned class.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning\nand activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per\ninput. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large\nlanguage models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain\nforgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant\neffectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while\nmitigating forgetting."}

This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks.

Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,\naiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.\nEach generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,\nconditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This\ndesign is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional\ngeneration frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a\ntraining framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and\neliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more\naccessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates\nmultiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading\nto higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines."}
