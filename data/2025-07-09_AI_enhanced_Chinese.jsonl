Vision-based pose\nestimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling\nsolution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting\nconditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,\nblooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic\nor event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions.

To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,\nthe social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the\ngeneralization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to\nremember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific\nparameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and\nanticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time\ndynamics model.

Our\nkey technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the\nQ-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric\nvisual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables\nthe LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual\nevidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with\nlarge-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted\ninstruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced\nreasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.\nNotably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning\ntasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of\neach architectural component.
