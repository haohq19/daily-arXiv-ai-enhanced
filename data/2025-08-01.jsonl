The situation is\nevolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the\nintelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,\ntraditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex\ninteractions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in\nthis paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard\nforecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize\nmeteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United\nStates (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our\nframework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,\nfrost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.\nThe framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a\nrecurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal\nexplanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but\nprecisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive\naccuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's\ncapacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research\nsignificantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard\nEWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process\nfor climate risk management in the agricultural industry."}

When these opinions form an argumentative structure around\nforecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an\nargumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a\nproperty of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a\nforecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three\nevaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of\nenforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive\nwith human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent\npredictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the\npractical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via\ncrowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent\nintuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence\nproperty.

Weight and activation quantization\n(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and\narithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ\ndesigns. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.\nOffline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant\nmodel performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques\nintroduce substantial runtime overhead.\n  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nWAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose\nKLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based\ncomputation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations\non K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and\nfull-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier\ndetection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and\nsmallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.\n  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,\n7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the\nA100 GPU and Atom, respectively."}

However, it is a challenge to train\nSNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient\napproximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment\nlimitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements\nof backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward\n(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural\nNetworks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby\neliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing\ncomputational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity\nadaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on\ninter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network\nresources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and\n75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,\nsurpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed\nmethod exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and\ncomputational power consumption."}

While\ntraditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed\nassessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit\nscalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a\nmultimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average\nUniversal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The\nmodel fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and\nhourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)\narchitecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric\ncontext. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical\naccuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\\deg}C,\nwhile reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire\ncity. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate\nsystematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare\nearth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially\nheterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree\nconversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\\deg}C average\nchange in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further\nreveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover\nproportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,\nfine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling\nscenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban\nenvironments."}

To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian\ninitialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid\nconstraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth.
