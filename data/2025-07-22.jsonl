However,\ntraditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training\ndata and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,\nthe cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.\nMeanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the\nmodel's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a\nsemi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual\ncontrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for\ndistributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.\nIt enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and\nfacilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving\nmutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,\nfirst, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is\ndesigned to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the\nsemi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are\naggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to\nshare knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework,\nexperiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset\ncollected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only\n10\\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by\n1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods."}

In this\nwork, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for\nhovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution.

However,\ntraditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training\ndata and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,\nthe cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.\nMeanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the\nmodel's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a\nsemi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual\ncontrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for\ndistributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.\nIt enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and\nfacilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving\nmutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,\nfirst, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is\ndesigned to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the\nsemi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are\naggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to\nshare knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework,\nexperiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset\ncollected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only\n10\\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by\n1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods."}

While the typical standard federated learning (FL)\nsupports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of\nattack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this\ndirection to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments\nhas turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces\nFLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM\nfine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic\nincentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable\nprotocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first\nempirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain,\ndecentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against\nbackdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters\nsynergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in\nadversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior\ncross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their\nown specialized data."}

The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without\nsacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that\ntreats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a\nhybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nto capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural\nOperator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river\nreach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal\neight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and\nboundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67\nreaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a\nyear-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong\npredictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet.\nCritically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the\nrequired wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly\n3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach\ndemonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed\nreplacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational\nfeasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting."}
