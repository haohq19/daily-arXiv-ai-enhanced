This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic\ncomplexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.\nIntuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict\nattention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.\nSuch approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and\nclearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity\nbehaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in\neach head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising\nsteps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention\nmethods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to\ncapture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in\nearly denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel\nsparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only\nrequires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them\nacross all steps.

However, prevailing methods often rely on\nmixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it\nnot feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining\nweights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with\nhardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training\nwith massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large\nnumber of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because\nthese weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable\nescape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.\nTo address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization\noptimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing\nthem as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a\ncontinuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,\nmeaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model\ncapacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC\nbenchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly\nmatching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference\nspeedup.

We propose Uni4D-LLM,\nthe first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene\nunderstanding and generation.

We extract semantic features for\nunderstanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,\nincorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual\nrepresentation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a\nshared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer\nbackbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific\nheads.

We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from\nsuch non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust\nmodels with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to\npoor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \\emph{suboptimal transfer}. In\nchallenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting\nperformance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure.

Despite their\nprevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains\nelusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and\nmodel architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model\npredictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay\nbetween feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly\ninvestigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of\npost-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic\nregression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,\nand finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we\nexplore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance\nthrough controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a\ndiverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating\nconsistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By\nexamining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing\nonly informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise\ndimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability\nof different calibration approaches.

However, prevailing methods often rely on\nmixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it\nnot feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining\nweights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with\nhardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training\nwith massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large\nnumber of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because\nthese weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable\nescape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.\nTo address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization\noptimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing\nthem as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a\ncontinuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,\nmeaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model\ncapacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC\nbenchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly\nmatching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference\nspeedup.

In\nthis work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to\noverfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain\nscenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named\nFlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists\nof: (1) Latent Shifting.

We learn this representation by predicting future events\nfrom past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion\ninformation. $\\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to\nnoise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas\nfrom multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and\n440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous\nspatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream\ntasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from\nthree robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),\nacross different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments\n(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors\n(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at\n25-75 Hz at HD resolution."}
