Prior work has\nexplored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can\nimprove downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward\nstructure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable\nfine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action\ntypes and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and\nvalues), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental\nresults show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%\ncompared to the baseline."}

The state and error covariance\nestimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative\nmeasurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We\nintegrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in\norder to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates\nwith each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least\nsquares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the\nproposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,\nnoisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position\nmeasured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation\nproblems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized\nsimulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic\njoint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs.

Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value\nIteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using\nProximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the\nmodel-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model\ncombining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is\ndeveloped for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with\nPoisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment\ntimes. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using\nthe simulation model.

Safety and driver assistance\nsystems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly\nenhancing their effectiveness.

This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed\nunderstanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal\nModels (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists\nof two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'\nunderstanding of temporal driving scenes.

To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we\npropose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM\ninstruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like\nMLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'\ngeneralizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on\nfine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap\nbetween MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on\nquestion-answering tasks by up to 73.2%.
