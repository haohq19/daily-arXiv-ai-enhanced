We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly\nreason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization\nconcerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery?

The findings reveal a clear\ndominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,\nand significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed\nacross outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a\nhuman-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers\nrecognize hidden affective framing in daily news."}

Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2\ndiabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely\ninterventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn\ncontinuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event\nsamples and patient heterogeneity (\\eg different progression rates and\npathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack\nadaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex\ncontinuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on\nclinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and\nlearns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.\nTD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the\ninterdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and\ninter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets\ndemonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the\nprogression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases."}

To train a robust model for\nmulti-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various\nmedical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing\nacross institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to\naddress this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect\nof data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large\nnumbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL\nmethod. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating\nclient-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to\ncoordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the\ncontributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,\nwhile the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global\noptimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data\ndistributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a\nhierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical\ninformation required for model updates. Experiments on five classification\ntasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be\nreleased upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed."}

With\nthe rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale\ndata, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future\nevents, an emerging paradigm we call \"LLM-as-a-Prophet\". This paper\nsystematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,\nwe build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously\ncollects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline\nstages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive\nforecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,\nconsistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also\nuncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via\nLLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of\ndata sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when\nresolution nears."}
