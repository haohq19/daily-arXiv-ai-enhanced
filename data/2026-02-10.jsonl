We present BiomechAgent, a code-generating AI agent that enables biomechanical analysis through natural language and allows users to querying databases, generating visualizations, and even interpret data without requiring users to write code. To evaluate BiomechAgent's capabilities, we developed a systematic benchmark spanning data retrieval, visualization, activity classification, temporal segmentation, and clinical reasoning. BiomechAgent achieved robust accuracy on data retrieval and visualization tasks and demonstrated emerging clinical reasoning capabilities. We used our dataset to systematically evaluate several of our design decisions. Biomechanically-informed, domain-specific instructions significantly improved performance over generic prompts, and integrating validated specialized tools for gait event detection substantially boosted accuracy on challenging spatiotemporal analysis where the base agent struggled. We also tested BiomechAgent using a local open-weight model instead of a frontier cloud based LLM and found that perform was substantially diminished in most domains other than database retrieval. In short, BiomechAgent makes the data from accessible motion capture and much more useful and accessible to end users."}

While these metrics are invaluable for valuation and retrospective analysis, they do not define a generative model of how baseball games unfold pitch by pitch, leaving most existing approaches limited to single-step prediction or post-hoc analysis. In this work, we present Neural Sabermetrics with World Model, a Large Language Model (LLM) based play-by-play world model for baseball. We cast baseball games as long auto-regressive sequences of events and continuously pretrain a single LLM on more than ten years of Major League Baseball (MLB) tracking data, comprising over seven million pitch sequences and approximately three billion tokens. The resulting model is capable of predicting multiple aspects of game evolution within a unified framework. We evaluate our model on both in-distribution regular-season data and out-of-distribution postseason games and compare against strong neural baselines from prior work. Despite using a single backbone model, our approach outperforms the performance of existing baselines, (1) correctly predicting approximately 64% of next pitches within a plate appearance and (2) 78% of batter swing decisions, suggesting that LLMs can serve as effective world models for sports."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

Generative AI has shown promise in increasing data volume and enhancing model training, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, generating physiological time-series data, a common type in medical AI applications, presents unique challenges due to its inherent complexity and variability. This paper introduces TransConv-DDPM, an enhanced generative AI method for biomechanical and physiological time-series data generation. The model employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with U-Net, multi-scale convolution modules, and a transformer layer to capture both global and local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset. These findings highlight the potential of TransConv-DDPM to generate high-quality synthetic data for real-world applications."}

Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds."}

By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats.

Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines.

The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training.

In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.\n  In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(ηC + \\sqrt{K/η})$ regret bound, where $η$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $η$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results."}

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments."}

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods."}

We evaluate AdvSR on three SR architectures (SRCNN, EDSR, SwinIR) paired with a YOLOv11 classifier and demonstrate that AdvSR models can achieve high attack success rates with minimal quality degradation.

Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data.

Implicit methods, on the other hand, capture high-level implicit motion semantics directly from the driving video, but suffer from identity leakage and entanglement between motion and appearance. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel implicit motion representation that compresses per-frame motion into compact 1D motion tokens. This design relaxes strict spatial constraints inherent in 2D representations and effectively prevents identity information leakage from the motion video. Furthermore, we design a temporally consistent mask token-based retargeting module that enforces a temporal training bottleneck, mitigating interference from the source images' motion and improving retargeting consistency. Our methodology employs a three-stage training strategy to enhance the training efficiency and ensure high fidelity.

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials. The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions."}

To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis. To bridge the domain gap, we devise a Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration strategy. This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation.

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines.

In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks.

We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy."}

To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints.

Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves higher edge estimation accuracy than existing methods while requiring less computation time. To further demonstrate its practical value, we also present a case study using real-world data. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Higashiguchi-Shingo/KTVGL."}

Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer.

To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate that PRO-Bid achieves superior constraint satisfaction and value acquisition compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms. Extensive experiments across offline RL benchmarks show that PAR consistently improves performance and approaches state-of-the-art when combined with the basic TD3+BC."}

SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts.

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy."}

However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking.

In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems.

To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Our method applies a closed-form projection after each update to keep the latent vector explicitly noise-like throughout optimization, preventing the drift that leads to unrealistic artifacts. This enforcement adds minimal cost: the projection matches the $O(N \\log N)$ complexity of standard algorithms such as sorting or FFT and does not practically increase wall-clock time. In experiments, our approach reaches a comparable Aesthetic Score using only 30% of the wall-clock time required by the SOTA regularization-based method, while preventing reward hacking."}

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons.

Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.\n  We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning."}

Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Kirin, under a W4A4\\&8 quantization setting, achieves near-FP16 accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 84.66\\% and shortening time steps by 93.75\\%."}

A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems. Nevertheless, research into adversarial attacks on events is scarce. This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \\textbf{M}otion-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{Adv}ersarial framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate adversarial events by leveraging point cloud representations. MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems."}

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events.

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving."}

Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs. We introduce the Verifiable Iterative Refinement Framework (VIRF), a neuro-symbolic architecture that shifts the paradigm from passive safety gatekeeping to active collaboration. Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}
