While the simplicity and\nversatility of parallel grippers have led to widespread adoption, these\ngrippers are limited by their heavy reliance on visual feedback. Tactile\nsensing and soft robotics can add responsiveness and compliance. However,\nexisting methods typically involve high integration complexity or suffer from\nslow response times. In this work, we introduce FORTE, a tactile sensing system\nembedded in compliant gripper fingers. FORTE uses 3D-printed fin-ray grippers\nwith internal air channels to provide low-latency force and slip feedback.\nFORTE applies just enough force to grasp objects without damaging them, while\nremaining easy to fabricate and integrate. We find that FORTE can accurately\nestimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect\nslip events within 100 ms of occurring. We demonstrate FORTE's ability to grasp\na wide range of slippery, fragile, and deformable objects. In particular, FORTE\ngrasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success\nrate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events. These results\nhighlight FORTE's potential as a robust and practical solution for enabling\ndelicate robotic manipulation. Project page: https://merge-lab.github.io/FORTE"}

The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates.

While large language models (LLMs) offer significant\npotential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding\nof clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on\nhigh-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial\ndeployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that\nenhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference\ncapabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our\nframework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states\nand support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.\nIn addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the\ncounseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune\nresponses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling\nsettings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated\nby base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods."}

This study addresses the challenge of\nalcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to\nidentify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality\nin crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing\nthe BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)\nrevealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.\nStatistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the\ncrash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that\nalcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage\nof the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older\ndrivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of\nthis study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education\nand training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training\nprograms and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting\nand support evidence-based policymaking."}

We introduce Outlier-Safe\nPre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier\nformation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We\nvalidate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is\nthe first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive\n4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10\nbenchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%\ntraining overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis\n(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally\naltering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not\ninherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way\nfor more efficient LLM deployment.
