To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified\nframework for running several event-based localization methodologies across\nmultiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and\ndependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and\ninvocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To\ndemonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common\nevent-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the\nframework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple\nmethods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of\nparameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame\ngeneration to large variations in performance.

However, a key\nlimitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router,\nwhich prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model.\nTo overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router\nframework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the\nrouter by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity\nbetween the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,\nwhich are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the\noutput norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby\nenabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further\nsharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard\nMoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA\nblock that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our\nknowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can\nbe fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional\ninference-time cost or complexity.
