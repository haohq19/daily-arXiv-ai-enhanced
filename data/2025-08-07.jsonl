The Cases of Caste and Religion", "comment": "Accepted to AIES 2025", "summary": "Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been\nmeasured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global\nNorth-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

We evaluated the capabilities\nof four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as\nautonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely\nused target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before\nproceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We\nperformed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of\n70 items covering seven sensitive domains.

In this paper, we\nreveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear\nin completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting\ngradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be\nessential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded\ncompletions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward\nunlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading\nlearning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective\npolicy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative\nTrajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens\nappearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,\nprotects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To\nfurther prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy\nexceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence\nregularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,\nwhile still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,\nvalidated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks."}

Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based\non Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared\nrepresentation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal\nflickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of\ngeometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and\ninterpretability. To address this, we propose \\textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel\nframework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and\ndynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and\nallowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents\nmotion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent\nappearance refinement.

However,\ntraffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy\nconstraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for\ntraffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI\nsignificantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy\nregulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and\nfederated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,\nand MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs."}

Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training\nstrategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one\ndimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models.

Then, the\nagreement score is utilized in a \\textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor\nIdentification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features\nthrough global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The\nanchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an\n\\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic\nencoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating\nbetter temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks\nfor W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

The proposed system first employs an\nefficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an\nadaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type.\nMimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When\nRequired (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive\nSpike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible\nmechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while\npreserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual\nlearning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced\ncatastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\\% overall accuracy. Furthermore,\nsimulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity,\nhighlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware."}

However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack\ninterpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present\nGlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured\nclinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual\ndescriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual\nrepresentations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained\nconvolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using\na transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with\nmanually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused\ninto a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.\nExperiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that\nGlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation\naccuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent\npatterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings\ncontributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and\nscalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to\nother ophthalmic disorders."}

First, we\ndevelop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios\n(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced\nenvironmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we\nintroduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder\n(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn\nreal-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental\ndeviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving\nperformance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in real-world open-loop planning.
