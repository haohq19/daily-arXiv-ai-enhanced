Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical\nunderstanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training\nmethodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic\nsystems."}

Second, it updates only the located\nweights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which\nresults in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the\noptimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to\novercome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates\nthe weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two\nlow-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by\nintroducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the\nresulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,\nenabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant\nweights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that\nencourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their\nimportance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted\non classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different\npre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA\nperformance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.\n90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.\nCompared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%\nacross models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M.

Shihab Uddin", "Md Nazmus Shakib", "Rahul Bhadani"], "title": "Modeling Electric Vehicle Car-Following Behavior: Classical vs Machine Learning Approach", "comment": null, "summary": "The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an\nunderstanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop\nsmart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning\nmodels for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent\nDriver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative\nVelocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning\napproach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV\nfollowing an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving\nconditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE\nbetween predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts\nacceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate\nthe Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),\n0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,\nCACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings\nhighlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such\nmodels are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy\ntraffic dynamics in EV integrated environments."}

However, conventional parallel thinking faces two\nkey challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from\nscratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories\nduring answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full\nconsideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose\nParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first\nstage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences\ninto functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and\nbranching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed\nReasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress\ninformation relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final\nanswer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks\ndemonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in\nexploratory token consumption."}
