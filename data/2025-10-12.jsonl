For example, one pixel in the first\nframe might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second\nframe. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are\nrobust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,\nthe event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame\nlarge motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining\nlow-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address\nthis challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS\nusing both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between\nthese two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly\noptimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities.

We have designed and\nproposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent\nInteraction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the\nMemory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction\nlayer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and\nagents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This\nensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As\nthe core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down\ncommunication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service\ndiscovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless\ninterconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,\noperates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -\nExtraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the\nability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,\nthereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective\nintelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid\nengineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next\ngeneration of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications."}

To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual.

To address this,\nwe propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs\na dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It\ndynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and\npromptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models\nnavigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use\nimplicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal\nbeliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant\nimprovements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational\ncosts (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution\nfor deploying LLMs in social contexts."}

Given their growing societal\ninfluence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political\ndomain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic\nprocesses. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation\nacross eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test\n(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings\nof these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to\nexplore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,\nimplicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual\nversions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political\nalignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and\nextent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes\nelicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified\nvia explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and\nexplicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of\ntransparency or \"awareness\" regarding their inherent biases. This study\nunderscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs."}
