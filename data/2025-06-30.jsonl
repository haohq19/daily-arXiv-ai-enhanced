Despite significant advances in\nmobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that\nallow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive\nevaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data\ncollection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with\nadaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models\n(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale\nsimulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid\nframework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for\ngenerating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware\nmodifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we\nefficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole\npopulation of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to\nenvironmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like\nfootball games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular\ndesign facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation\nsystem and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational\nefficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in\nmobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems\nplanning and operations with benchmark algorithms.

To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List\nbased Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in\nlist format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,\nrequires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,\nwhich to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.\nWe investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of\nstate-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain\nsettings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,\nparticularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align\nfacts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain\nsetup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B\nsignificantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over\nthe base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning\nbenchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade\non general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating\nsuperior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad\napplicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal\nreasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at\nhttps://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1."}
