They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB\ncameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major\nchallenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume\nof triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission\nscheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while\naccomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and\nevent cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often\nresulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address\nthis, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to\neliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our\napproach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to\ndisentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.\nThis disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness\nand informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.\nMoreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene\ndynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to\nimages for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nscheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to\nconventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance."}

Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a\nshorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when\nfulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -\nallowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and\ncomplexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem\nwith V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select\ncustomer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or\ndischarge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging\nstation selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed\nInteger Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic\nalgorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood\nsearch (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver\nprofits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on\nsmall instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a\npromising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that\nactively support the energy grid."}

This paper\ninvestigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs\nresonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain\nsignals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By\nresonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral\nfeatures while maintaining low spiking activity.

This makes frequent\nassessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and\nminimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of\nrock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground\nmines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock\nbolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the\nautomatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point\nclouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing\ntechniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature\nengineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such\ntechniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due\nto data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.\nMoreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale\npoint clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of\nreinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an\napproach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning\narchitecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the\nautomatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point\nclouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation\nmodels by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.\nAdditionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,\nachieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,\ndemonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground\nenvironments."}
