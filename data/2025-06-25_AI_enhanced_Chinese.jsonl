While the simplicity and\nversatility of parallel grippers have led to widespread adoption, these\ngrippers are limited by their heavy reliance on visual feedback. Tactile\nsensing and soft robotics can add responsiveness and compliance. However,\nexisting methods typically involve high integration complexity or suffer from\nslow response times. In this work, we introduce FORTE, a tactile sensing system\nembedded in compliant gripper fingers. FORTE uses 3D-printed fin-ray grippers\nwith internal air channels to provide low-latency force and slip feedback.\nFORTE applies just enough force to grasp objects without damaging them, while\nremaining easy to fabricate and integrate. We find that FORTE can accurately\nestimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect\nslip events within 100 ms of occurring. We demonstrate FORTE's ability to grasp\na wide range of slippery, fragile, and deformable objects. In particular, FORTE\ngrasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success\nrate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events. These results\nhighlight FORTE's potential as a robust and practical solution for enabling\ndelicate robotic manipulation.

The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended\nknowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their\ncommonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from\nmethodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task\nof prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on\ncommonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated\ndialogues.\n  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200\nrandomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue\ndatasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event\ncommonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency\nof LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly\nup to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations.

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare\ndiseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is\ncostly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The\nmanual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours\nper disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC\nalgorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,\nexpert-created knowledge base.

Such reliance on irrelevant features,\noften called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including\nmedical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to\nreal-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided\nby humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.\nThese annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of\nfeature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.\nUnfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are\nunreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize.

We identify the core computational\nbottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly\nmatrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we\npropose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector\nmultiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational\ncost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an\nefficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in\nCayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow\nOFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage\nwithout compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support\nfinetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular\nQLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "OFTv2\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5fc3\u91cd\u6784\u548cCayley-Neumann\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86OFT\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "OFT\u7684\u9ad8\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOFTv2\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5fc3\u91cd\u6784\uff08\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\uff09\u548cCayley-Neumann\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u9006\uff09\u3002", "result": "OFTv2\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710\u500d\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e3\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "OFTv2\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}
